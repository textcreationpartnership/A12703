            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Whereupon hauing at the earneſt and importunate ſute and requeſt of diuers of my worſhipfull and good friendes, not long ſince committed to writing the Treatiſe following (which
<pb facs="tcp:2586:4"/>in effect they first heard me from point to point in this manner deliuer vnto them in certeine ſermons) I haue now thought it good in this ſort ſomewhat enlarged to publiſh it, the better to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie their deſires: and to the end a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, I haue made bolde to dedicate the ſame vnto your Grace, beſeeching you to accept therof rather according to the minde of the offerer (which I proteſt vnto you is full of loue and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence towardes you,) than to the ſimplicitie &amp; meaneſſe of the thing it ſelfe, which I muſt needes confeſſe in respect of the handling, is much vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie of ſuch an Honourable pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trone as your ſelfe is. As for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it is (I am perſwaded) anſwerable to the title that I haue giuen it, which is, The high way to Heauen. For therin
<pb facs="tcp:2586:5"/>firſt is ſhewed howe the lawe is our ſchoolemaiſter to Chriſt, by cauſing vs to knowe our ſinnes, and to feele the weight and burthen thereof to make vs wearie of the ſame, and therefore to hunger and thirſt after him: and then what Chriſt is in perſon and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and how he is to be apprehended and fed on to ſaluation by a true and liuely ſaith in him, is largely &amp; plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie declared: and lastly alſo, heerein ſuch as are and haue beene firſt duely throwen downe by the lawe, and after truelie raiſed vp againe by the Goſpel, in Christ, are taught how they are to liue and ſpend the reſt of their daies in holineſſe and righteouſneſſe. Which I am ſure is the olde ancient beaten waie throughout all the whole courſe of the olde and new Testament, and in
<pb facs="tcp:2586:5"/>all ſound antiquitie, that the ſaints and ſeruantes of God haue taken to be the onelie ſaife and ſure wace, wherby they haue ſought to come to the kingdom of heauen. Your Grace therfore being one (as I fullie perſwade my ſelfe you are) that ſeeke to come thither by this onelie waie, and therefore one alſo that is verie deſirous that all others ſhould walke thitherwards in an eauen and ſtreight courſe therunto; in reſpect of the matter therein handled, my good hope is, you will not be aſhamed or thinke much at all, that it ſeeketh thus to come abroad vnder your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance &amp; protection. For though the waie be neuer ſo well knowne alreadie and be beaten and trode out by manie before this, and that perhaps more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly and ſubſtantially than it is here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb facs="tcp:2586:6"/>in by me: yet ſeeing manie are ſtill to go this ſame way, &amp; all cannot hit of the ſame guids, &amp; still Sathan wil be buſie by his complices eyther to keepe men fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> finding it, or by one ſleight or other to turne them out of it. I truſt that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo manie that haue gone before me in guiding men into and keeping them in this way, this my profered ſeruice to that end, may &amp; will bee yet profitable vnto many. Now theſe <hi>24.</hi> years at the leaſt it hath pleaſed the Lord to vſe my poore miniſtrie, and that, his name be bleſſed for it, in great peace &amp; quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſse, &amp; yet I haue therin alwaies bene of this mind, and am &amp; will be ſtil, not to eſteeme or know anie thing, but euen this way through Ieſus Christ and him crucified. <hi>1.</hi> Cor. <hi>2.2.</hi> And ſure I am I find and I perſwade my ſelfe I ſhall still,
<pb facs="tcp:2586:6"/>though I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued therin twiſe as long more, this to be a matter ſo neceſſarie and of that importance beyond all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to be inſiſted in and dwelt vpon, that I ſhould neuer haue either leaſure or pleaſure to trouble eyther preſſe or pulpit with any thing without the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie bondes and ſtrict limites hereof. For (alas) euery where, yea euen where moſt paines hath bene taken and yet is by catechiſing of &amp; conference with the people, yea by view of their liues, there is eyther ſuch groſſe ignorance heereof, or erring or halting heerein to be found &amp; ſeene amongſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that if all the ministers of England had the tongues both of men and Angels, they ſhould find work inough through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to employ themſelues in, onelie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the reformation heereof. I would
<pb facs="tcp:2586:7"/>to God therfore, that all controuerſies, wherof men may be ignorant without danger either of not finding, or of not leaſing this heauenly way, might either be kept and reſerued onely to brotherly and friendlie conferences among the godlie learned, or elſe that for euer they might be faire dead and buried amongſt vs; and that ſo, that all of vs as one man with one heart and with one mind, might &amp; would ioyne all our forces together to leade men aright in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this waie, and to keepe them on streight in the ſame, what ſubtiltie and cunning ſoeuer Sathan and his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentes ſhould at anie time vſe to the contrarie. For we may be ſure, ſo that he any way can get men to miſse or to leaſe this waie whiles we are buſying our owne heades and the peoples with
<pb facs="tcp:2586:7"/>other matters of farre leſſe impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, though therein we ſhew neuer ſo much zeale and learning, he hath the verie thing he deſireth. For that doubtleſſe hath beene and is ſtill a dangerous ſtratageme or pollicie of his, when he findeth he cannot as he would preuaile by keeping men in ignorance and careleſſe ſecurity, then to doe what he can, that they may ſpend their lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and zeale about matters of the leaſt moment; that in the meane time he may the more quietlie by their ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in matters of greateſt weight, by the other contrary way, as it were paue the waie to Atheiſme: yea I feare much (to ſpeake plainely what I thinke) that lacke of due conſideration hereof in time, in ſome hath not onelie beene one of the next cauſes of the phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall
<pb facs="tcp:2586:8"/>ſectes of the Browniſtes, and Familiſtes, but alſo of too ſhamefull encreaſe, in ſo great light of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, both of Papistes and Atheistes amongeſt vs. Wherefore my heartes deſire and prayer to God for England is and euer ſhall be, and for all the Churches of Chriſt whereſoeuer in the wide world, that this ſubtiltie of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than may both heere and euerie where be throughlie well lookt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and the miſchiefe thence enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be as carefully preuented as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiblie may be: for otherwiſe it may growe intollerable and vncurable. And J beſeech the Lord heartilie to giue your Grace and all the reſt of the reuerend Fathers the Biſhops of this land, and all others that be in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie with you in the ſame, both skill
<pb facs="tcp:2586:8"/>and will, power and might by the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his holie ſpirite ſpeedilie and effectuallie to cleanſe and purge theſe Churches of England and Ireland ſo, of all theſe foure kindes of dangerous aduerſaries, that without their ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of vs at the first, or ſeducing of vs afterward eyther of the right hand or of the left, all the reſt of vs as brethren and heires of the kingdom of heauen may both happilie get into this way thither, and alſo moſt ſtedfaſtlie and constantlie perſeuere therein euen vnto the verie end.</p>
            <p>Thus preſuming (as you ſee) of your Graces curteous and friendlie acceptance both of this my trauell in pointing out this waie, and alſo of this my bold dedicating the ſame vnto you: J will not ceaſe to praie vnto God to
<pb facs="tcp:2586:9"/>requite and recompence ſeauen-folde into your boſome both this &amp; all your great and vndeſerued former fauours towardes mee. And thus beſeeching him alſo long to preſerue you in health and honour to his glorie, the Churches good, &amp; to your owne euerlaſting com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort now &amp; euer; crauing alſo pardon for this my boldnes, and hoping therof, I moſt humblie take my leaue.

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:2586:10"/>and alſo to prooue you, to liſten thereunto the more religiouſly and attentiuely. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
<note place="margin">The me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod.</note> the method that he hath followed, and that therefore likewiſe I muſt, is this; Firſt, hee noteth certaine circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces thereof, then the ſubſtance of the ſermon it ſelfe. The circumſtances hee expreſſeth in theſe wordes, <hi>Nowe in the laſt and greate day of the feaſt, Ieſus ſtood and cryed ſaying:</hi> and the ſermon in the reſt: and that in this order. Firſt he no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to whom he directed it, and his ſpeech therein, ſaying that he beganne it thus, <hi>If any man thirſt:</hi> then in the reſt, what it was that he ſpake vnto ſuch: Nowe the ſumme of his ſpeeches (as he hath heere recorded it) conſiſted of two pointes: firſt of a commaundement that he gaue to them to whome he ſpake, and then of a promiſe that he made them, obeying that commaundement of his. The commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement the Euangeliſt ſaith, was this, <hi>Let him come to me and drinke:</hi> and the promiſe was this, <hi>hee that beleeueth in mee as ſaith the ſcripture, out of his belly ſhall flowe ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of waters of life.</hi> So that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded two thinges: firſt a comming vnto him, and then a drinking of him: and foraſmuch as the promiſe was thus
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:2586:10"/>deliuered in a figuratiue and metaphoricall kinde of phraſe, the Euangeliſt directed by the ſpiritte of God, of a care he had to leade men to the right vnderſtanding of Chriſtes meaning therein, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue them from miſtaking of the ſame, telleth vs plainely, that by the riuers of waters of life, that Chriſt ſpake of in this promiſe of his, he vnderſtoode, <hi>the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritte which they that beleeued in him, ſhoulde receiue,</hi> adding withall, that that was not in ſuch meaſure yet powred vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon ſuch, as it ſhoulde be afterward, for that <hi>Ieſus was not yet glorified;</hi> for ſo his wordes, <hi>the holie Ghoſt was not yet,</hi> muſt be vnderſtoode as I ſhall ſhewe,
<note place="margin">The circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</note> when I come vnto them. Wherefore nowe to proſecute theſe thinges in order as they lie, as they ſhall offer themſelues vnto vs in the text. Firſt we haue to conſider what he hath ſaide concerning the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumſtances of this ſermon. Touching which, <hi>nowe in the laſt and greate daie of the feaſt, Ieſus ſtoode and cryed</hi> (ſaith the Euangeliſt:) for the better vnderſtanding of which wordes, if we peruſe the former part of this Chapter, it will euidentlie appeare vnto vs, that when Chriſt made this ſermon, he was at <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:2586:11"/>in the temple there, by occaſion of the feaſt of tabernacles, which then there they kept &amp; ſolemnized; where and when the Iewes ſought to take him, and therfore pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely the phariſies, and high prieſtes ſent officers thither, and that to the end that ſo he being taken, they might kill him, whereof Chriſt was not ignorant. For there before this, at this verie feaſt, teaching o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly out of the ſcriptures, to the aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all his enemies, that heard him, he ſaith ſlatly vnto them, <hi>verſ.</hi> 19. <hi>Why goe yee about to kill me?</hi> Nowe the laſt day of this feaſt as we may ſee. <hi>Leuit.</hi> 23. <hi>verſ.</hi> 36 was the eight day when by Gods ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce they were to haue an holie conuocation, and a ſolemne aſſemblie: vpon which daie Ieſus ſtoode vp, and made this ſermon, with a lowde and crying voyce, that ſo the better he might be hearde through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that great aſſemblie and concourſe of people. All theſe thinges therefore laid together, ſhew vs plainely thus much, that Ieſus was the preacher of the ſermon, and where, when, and in what manner it was preached by him: namely, that it was preached at <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> euen in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, at and in the feaſt of tabernacles, and vpon the laſt and moſt ſolemne day therof,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:2586:11"/>and that in the middeſt of moſt bloody, and malitious enemies; moſt confidently, ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and boldly, for he vttered it ſtanding and crying, thereby ſhewing that he was neither afraide to be heard nor ſeene: yea, thereby making it moſt manifeſt, that he deſired nothing more, then that they ſhoulde thorowly both ſee and knowe his perſon, and vnderſtand and beleeue his doctrine. And yet for all this, howe deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſoeuer his enemies were, then to haue taken him, <hi>yet no man had power to lay handes on him,</hi> as it is noted: <hi>Verſe.</hi> 44. yea they that were ſent to that ende, returned, and gaue this reaſon of their not touching him, <hi>that neuer man ſpake as he did, verſ.</hi> 46. The noting thus of theſe circumſtances, by the Euangeliſt, wee muſt not thinke was needleſſe, but to very good purpoſe: yea, we ought alwaies to aſſure our ſelues, howſoeuer in humane writings and ſpeeches, there may often be found many idle and ſuperfluous wordes, that it is neuor ſo in the Canonicall ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. For they beeing as they are, <hi>all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired of God,</hi> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. <hi>verſ.</hi> 16, and the holy writers thereof, ſpeaking and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting therein onely, <hi>as they were mooued by the holie Ghoſt,</hi> as <hi>Peter</hi> teſtifieth of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:2586:12"/>them, 2. <hi>Pet. verſ.</hi> 21. we may be ſure they haue not vttered or ſet downe any word in vaine therein. And if we doe but a little weigh and conſider of thoſe circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, thus ſet downe heere by ſaint <hi>Iohn</hi> how ſleight ſoeuer the vſe thereof ſeeme to vs at the firſt we ſhall ſoone perceiue, that there is both much and very good vſe to be made thereof. For firſt notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the corruptions of thoſe times, in that Chriſt would come to <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> to the feaſt of tabernacles, we may learne, not onely Chriſtes obedience to Gods ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall lawe, as then yet ſtanding in force and not abrogated, to teach vs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies to be obedient to his perpetuall lawes: But alſo, that it is not lawfull, ſciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticallie (as Anabaptiſtes, Browniſtes, and they of the familie of loue and others doe) to ſhunne publike aſſemblies, and the exerciſes of true religion therein, for euery ſmall corruption and ſuperſtitious faſhion, either but ſeeming to ſuch ſo to bee, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede which are ſo to be found therein. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that then both in the prieſtes and in their additions and detractions from the lawe of God, the corruptions were many, groſſe and euident, as the Euangeliſtes and ſtories of thoſe times, make it moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:2586:12"/>and yet as we may ſee by this, Chriſt ſhunned not the temple and their aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies there. And in that Chriſt there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the greateſt and ſpitefulleſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies that he had, preached and taught thus boldlie: Further there by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample he hath giuen vs to learne, that hauing a lawfull calling, and a good cauſe as he had, neither daungerouſneſſe of the time, place, or perſons, that we hau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> to deale withall, ought to make vs ſhrink from execution and vrging of the ſame. His choiſe of this day rather then an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to make this ſermon in, his ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to vtter it, and his vttering it, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, argue that he had a care, and an earneſt deſire, that it both might be heard of as manie as might bee, and alſo be well vnderſtoode and caryed awaye, for then was it likelie the audience was the greateſt, and that which they hearde laſt (as <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> verie well obſerueth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon this place in his fiftith Homilie of Sainte <hi>Iohn,</hi>) eſpeciallie vttered in this ſorte, was alſo likelie beſt to be regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and marked of them: which may verie well teach vs in all our actions and deedes, both wiſelie to make a choiſe of our time, to doe them, when
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:2586:13"/>there is moſt likelihood to doe good there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to moſt, and alſo in the buſineſſe of the Lord to deale faithfully and confidentlie, and in no caſe boldlie, but zealouſly and earneſtly. And the better to encourage vs therein, to followe our Lorde and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, it is worthie the noting, that for all his thus dealing, and the ſet purpoſe of his enemies then to take him, that yet he departed thence ſafe, without any trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; for vntill the time appointed of our heauenly father be come; wee may ſee by this, we may and ſhall ſafely proceed on, in the diſcharging the dueties of our vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, what dangers ſoeuer otherwiſe in the meane time, ſeeme to lie in the way to ſtop vs, or to cut vs off. And laſtly this earneſtneſſe of Chriſt about the deliuerie of this doctrine, ſhewed both in his ſtanding and vttering of it, crying, may teach vs that he ſaw of the one ſide, the matter was worth the hearing, &amp; of the other ſide, that there was in his hearers ſuch dulneſſe, notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to liſten as they ſhould thereunto, that al this would be little inough: the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof ought to mooue you, that be hearers, to rowſe vp your ſpirittes, to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten thereunto more attentiuely: and ſtraightlie it vrgeth me to be as ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:2586:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>and vehement as I can, in the opening the ſame vnto you: and ſo conſequentlie may and ought to ſtand in ſteade of a moſt forcible place, both to me and you, to bid vs, both in ſpeaking and hearing hereof, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie way, to behaue our ſelues righteouſly.</p>
            <p>Wherefore thus by theſe circumſtances and the vſe thereof, we being (I hope) prepared to doe: let vs now go on as it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth. <hi>Yf any man thirſt,</hi> ſaith Chriſt,
<note place="margin">To whom he ſpake.</note> whereby it appeareth, that he directeth his ſpeech, although to al that thirſted, without exception, whatſoeuer they had beene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, yet to none but to ſuch, for he knewe well inough that none but ſuch would ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther regarde his commaundement or had any right vnto, or portion in, the promiſe that he me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to make. In the very ſame ſenſe ſaith <hi>Eſay,</hi> in the perſon of God. <hi>Cap.</hi> 55.1. <hi>Ho, euery one that thirſteth, come ye to the waters, &amp;c.</hi> and the ſame prophet, <hi>Cap.</hi> 44. <hi>verſe.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3. bringeth in the Lord, ſaying, <hi>Feare not ô Iacob my ſeruant, and thou righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous whom I haue choſen: for I will powre water vpon the thirſtie, and floudes vpon the drie ground, &amp;c.</hi> Likewiſe of the ſame kind of men ſpake Chriſt, <hi>Math.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Bleſſed are they that hunger and thirſt for righteouſneſſe, for they ſhall be filled.</hi> And in the chapter
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:2586:14"/>going before this, whence I haue my text, where Chriſt teacheth, that, <hi>He is the bread of life, and that his fleſh is meate indeed, and his bloode drinke indeede,</hi> he ſayeth, <hi>hee that commeth vnto him ſhall neuer hunger, and he that beleeueth in him, ſhal neuer thirſt. verſ.</hi> 35. By all which places laid together we may ſee that it is an vſuall thing with the Lord, by thirſtineſſe to deſcribe them, to whome with any hope to doe good he ſpeaketh, and to whome he vſeth to make his gracious promiſes: and that though ſometimes he name thirſtineſſe onely, that yet he ſometimes alſo requireth both hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and thirſt expreſſely; thereby teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vs, that when the one is onely na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to vnderſtand the other alſo. Nowe for as much as the meate and drinke talked of in any of theſe places, to ſatisfie the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie and thirſty, is neither earthly nor ſuch as we vſe to take in by the mouth and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inſtrumentes of the bodie, but alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither heauenly, and ſuch as muſt be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten &amp; drunken by the mouth of our ſoules: therefore we may be ſure that herein there is a metaphor vſed, and that in this phraſe and ſpeech, by a ſimilitude betwixt the hunger and thirſt of the bodie and the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the ſoule, by thoſe termes the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:2586:14"/>Lord meaneth, the like paſſions and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the ſoule afore towards the meare and drinke prepared therefore, as is founde in the bodie after meate and drinke mee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e and fit for it.
<note place="margin">What it is to thirſt.</note> Seeing then that the ground and foundation of ſuch metaphors is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies the analogie and reſemblance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the metaphoricall wordes, and the thinges for the expreſſing whereof they are vſed, we ſhal the better vnderſtande what is ment heereby by the hunger and thirſt of the ſoule, if we doe but conſider that bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily hunger is an earneſt longing after meat for the body proceeding from a ſenſible feeling of emptines and want thereof: and that bodily thirſt, is an earneſt longing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter moyſture to remooue the heate and drineſſe that for lacke therof troubleth the bodye, for what is this ſpirituall hunger and thirſt elſe, but an earneſt longing for ſaluation onely in Chriſt Ieſus, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from an effectuall feeling of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but damnation to be due vnto vs, in reſpecte of our ſelues? And therefore the ſoule that is inwardlie tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, vexed, troubled and diſquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with a due ſighte and feeling of the owne emptineſſe, to iuſtifie or ſaue it ſelfe: yea, that naturallie findeth
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:2586:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>it ſelfe promiſed with nothing elſe, but with the ſcorching heate of ſinne, and drought of all goodneſſe, doubtleſſe will ſo hunger and thirſt, that is, ſo earneſtly and vnfamedly long and deſire to be deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from this ſtate and condition, that in trueth, without all hypocriſie it will be readie to ſay with <hi>Daeuid, that as the Hart brareth after the riuers of matters, ſo it doth after the liuing God. Pſal.</hi> 42. <hi>verſe.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2. But to put it out of all doubt, that here by the hungrie and thirſtie, are ment onely ſuch: compare here with the very like ſpeech of Chriſt, <hi>Math.</hi> 11. <hi>verſ.</hi> 28. where he ſaid: <hi>Come vnto me, all ye that are wearie and laden, and I will caſe you.</hi> For euen there as heere, he firſt deſcribeth them, to whom he ſpake, ſecondly he telleth them what he would haue them to doe, and laſtly, hee giueth them a ſweete promiſe, which they ſhould enioy if they would ſo doe. So that though there be ſome difference betwixt the wordes of Chriſt there and heere, in ſound, yet little or none is there in ſenſe: wherefore in ſteede of the hungry and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie here in this place, he there placeth the wearie and laden: whereby he vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them, that being heauy laden with ſin, (as we are all) are growne alſo to be wearie
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:2586:15"/>thereof, which no man may or can thinke himſelfe to be, as long as he continueth ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely, in going on in ſinne, ſo adding ſin to ſin. For he that is weary of his burthen, hath a deſire to be eaſed therof, and in the meane time, vntill he can get quite to be diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of it, he himſelfe rather daily ſeeketh to leſſen it, then to increaſe it. The bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and contrite heart therefore vnder the burthen of ſinne, and that groneth, and is inwardly diſquieted in his verie ſoule, with the feeling and ſmarte thereof, is the man that will hunger and thirſt after Chriſt, that ſo in him, and by him, he may be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and deliuered: and thereſore ſuch are the onely men to whom Chriſt heere ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth. At this pointe was <hi>Dauid</hi> Pſalm. 6. when he wrote, <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3. <hi>Haue mercie vpon me (O Lord) for I am weake, O Lord) heale me, for my bones are vexed, and my ſoule is alſo ſoretroubled, &amp;c.</hi> But being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in the ſame caſe, (as it appeareth, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 51.) he comforteth himſelf with this, <hi>ver.</hi> 17 <hi>That the ſacrifices of God were a contriteſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and that a contrite spirit and broken hart, he would not deſpiſe.</hi> And good reaſon hath euerie man to be of his mind. For <hi>Eſay.</hi> 61 1.2.3. (for ſo Chriſt himſelfe hath taught vs to apply it) it is ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>that the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:2586:16"/>ſpiritte of the Lorde was vppon him, and that therefore he had annointed him, and ſent him to preach good tidinges vnto the poore, to binde vppe the broken hearted, to preach libertie to the captiues, and to them that are bounde, the openinge of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, &amp;c.</hi> And therefore after in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of GOD, ſaith the prophet: <hi>to him will I looke, euen to him that is poore, and of a contrite ſpiritte, and trembleth at my wordes, wherefore heare the worde of the Lorde, yee that tremble at his wordes, Eſay.</hi> 66. <hi>verſe.</hi> 6. and euen to this Chriſt had an eye, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.3.4.5. ſaying, <hi>Bleſſed are the poore in ſpiritte, for theirs is the kingdome of heauen. Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are they that mourne, for they ſhal be comforted. Bleſſed are the meeke, for they ſhall inherite the earth, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And hence came it, that the proude phariſie puft vppe with a conceite of his owne righteouſneſſe, wente home vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtified, and the poore publican throwne downe and humbled before GOD, in the ſight of his owne ſinnes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore crying, <hi>Lorde be mercifull vnto me a ſinner,</hi> wente home more iuſtified, <hi>Luke.</hi> 18.9. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for as Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.12.13. ſo it is moſt true, <hi>the whole neede
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:2586:16"/>not the phiſition, but they that are ſicke, and he came not to call the righteous, but ſinners to repentance.</hi> And alwaies it hath beene the Lordes faſhion, <hi>to reſiſt the proud, and to giue grace vnto the humble,</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.5. And therefore the bleſſed virgin obſerueth that, in her ſong, <hi>that as he ſcattered the proude, in the imagination of their heartes, and put the mightie downe from their ſeates, and ſendeth away the rich emptie, ſo he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alteth them of lowe degree, and filleth the hungrie with good thinges, Luke.</hi> 151. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This was the verie reaſon why Chriſt was ſo curteous to publicans and ſinners, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.10. and ſo bitter to the ſcribes and phariſies as he was, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And this made him ſay to the chiefe prieſtes and elders of the Iewes, verilie, verilie, <hi>the publicans and harlotes goe before you into the kingdome of God. Matth.</hi> 21.31.13. And hereunto (I take it) he had an eye, when he ſaid, <hi>the kingdome of heauen ſuffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.</hi> For whereas they that are not broken and contrite hearted for their ſinnes, but eyther liue in them in ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, or are puft vp with a ſwelling con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite of their owne merittes, make no haſte to Chriſt, they that are throughlie
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:2586:17"/>and duely humbled in and vnder their ſins, are glad to heare of him, and to preſſe withall haſt vnto him, for forgiueneſſe of them. And this we ſee moſt clearely in the examples of <hi>Zacheus, and Marie Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len:</hi> whereof the one (as we reade in <hi>Luke.</hi> 19.) <hi>Ranne vp into a wild fig tree,</hi> that he might ſatisfie himſelfe with ſeeing Chriſt, and no ſooner hearde Chriſt ſay vnto him, <hi>Come downe at once, but he came downe haſtelie, and receiued him ioyfully. verſ.</hi> 5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6. And the other, hearing of Chriſt, to teſtifie her vnfained ſorrowe for her ſinnes, and her loue to Chriſt, for that ſhe hoped by him to haue them forgiuen her, (as the ſame euangeliſt ſheweth, <hi>Cap.</hi> 7.37.38. preſſed after Chriſt, <hi>into a Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies houſe, as he ſat at meat, bringing with her a boxe of oyntment, to beſtow vpon him: whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther when ſhe came, ſhe ſtoode at his feete, behinde him weeping, and waſht his feete with teares, and wiped them with the heire of her heade, and kiſſed his feete, and annoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them with oyle.</hi> In all the ſtorie of the new teſtament, where haue we more hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie affection and earneſt hunger, and thirſt after Chriſt ſhewed, then in theſe two greate ſinners, when once the Lorde had made them to feele their ſinnes, and to be
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:2586:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>wearie of them. Nay this I dare and doe boldlie affirme, that if we peruſe the whole booke of God thorow we ſhall neuer find that eyther God the Father, or Chriſt his onely ſonne, euer comforted any before they were diſcomforted, or healed anie eyther of bodily or ſpiritual diſeaſe before they ſawe their diſeaſe, felt it, were weary of it; and therefore ſued for helpe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance. For why ſhould pearles be caſt before ſwine, or health be offered to thoſe that finde not wante of it, or meate and drink be ſet before thoſe that neither hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger nor thirſt? Out of al queſtion therefore we muſt thus firſt hunger and thirſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we can be of the number of thoſe, to whome Chriſt will offer himſelfe eyther to be meate or drinke: and vnleſſe we feele our ſpirituall ſickneſſe of ſinne, and the danger thereof without him, he will be no phiſition of ours, and vnleſſe we haue good ſtomacks and appetites to and after the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table cheere, <hi>that alreadie is prepared for vs, in the marriage of the Kinges ſonne,</hi> (wherof <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               <hi>commeth the knowledge of ſinner Rom.</hi> 7. <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. yea, thereby as moſt nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie the Apoſtle ſheweth in that place, the power and tyranny of ſinne ouer vs, is moſt plainely deſcribed: in reſpect of which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the law, <hi>the law is ſaid to be our ſchool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter vnto Chriſt, Gal.</hi> 3.24. for whiles it maketh vs ſee our ſelues to be ſinners, and that great and dangerous ſinners, it cauſeth vs to deſpaire of heauen at all, by our own merits, yea, it driueth vs eyther to make no other reckoning, but to goe to hell, whether by our ſinnes we haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrued to goe, or elſe to ſeeke out of our ſelues quite, by faith in Chriſt Ieſus, to be iuſtified, and ſo to come to heauen by him. But this it cannot doe, vnleſſe we muſe and meditate thereon aright, and vnleſſe we vnderſtand it aright: for though it be ſet before vs of the Lord as a glaſſe to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer and lay before vs on the one ſide, what we owe vnto him, &amp; had beene abie to pay him, if we had continued in the ſtate wherin he created vs; &amp; of the other ſide to ſhewe vs that now by our ownfal we are become ſuch bankrupts, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ow gold we are not able to pay copper, yea, where we owe him thouſands we are not able to anſwere him one of a thouſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, yet vnles the lord open
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:2586:19"/>our eyes rightlie to vnderſtand this his law, it cannot nor wil not ſtande vs in this ſteed; for as the beſt glaſſe beeing looked into without light, directeth vs nothing, but when by the light it is looked vpon, it doth the office, euen ſo is it in this caſe. And therefore to this purpoſe we are to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand with <hi>Dauid, that the lawe of God is perfect,</hi> and in that reſpect (as gold is tried ſeauen times in the fire,) <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.7. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Wherefore we may be ſure it ſtretcheth, (rightly vnderſtoode) to the condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all ſinne whatſoeuer, and to the commendation of all vertue likewiſe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer; Inſomuch as it contayneth an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute and moſt perfect rule of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and holineſſe: from which as oft as we decline, eyther to the right hand, or to the left, in heart, worde, deede, or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, eyther in omitting thinges therein commaunded, or in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitting things therin forbidden, ſo oft it pronounceth vs to be tranſgreſſours thereof. Whereupon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequentlie it muſt needes be true, that if we iudge our owne ſelues but according to the lawe, we ſhall finde it as impoſſible for vs to number our ſinnes, as eyther it is to number the ſtarres of heauen, or the ſand of the ſea ſhore; the conſideration wherof,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:2586:19"/>ſeeing that the promiſe of the lawe is onely this, <hi>Doe this and liue, Leuit.</hi> 18.13. <hi>and he that faileth in one poynt is guilty of al.

And further ſeeing that the lawe is the lawe of God, who for that, he made vs able at the firſt to keepe it, may by good right ſtill call for the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of it at our handes; though before he call for it, he knoweth now that ſuch is our corruption of the one ſide, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of it of the other ſide, that we can not keepe it, thereby we are to learne to fall downe before him, and with the teares of our ſoules to confeſſe our debt, that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he demaundeth indeede to be due debt

O if we would, <hi>breake vp the fallowe landes of our heartes,</hi> (as we are counſelled to doe, <hi>Iere.</hi> 4.4.) by cauſing this ſharpe plowe of the law to make deepe forrowes in it. For then ſo much good feede of the goſpell, as is, woulde not daily be ſpilt and loſt vpon vs, for that our heartes for lacke heereof, are either like the high way, or like to ſtony or thorny ground. But fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that the hardneſſe of our hearts is ſuch that this plough alone wil not pearce deep inough to breake them vp, let vs adde thereunto the weight of Gods threatned iudgementes againſt the tranſgreſſours of the lawe. Entering into which meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we ſhall finde, firſt generally Gods curſe denounced againſt <hi>all thoſe that doe not obſerue and keepe all the words of the law, Deut.</hi> 27.26. And to goe no further, then to that Chapter and the next in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, we ſhall finde ſo manie moſt fearefull iudgementes threatened to all
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:2586:20"/>tranſgreſſours of the lawe, as that thereby wee may eaſelie perceiue, that to all tranſgreſſours thereof, the Lorde would haue vs to vnderſtande, that infinite and moſt intollerable are the plagues both in this life and that which is to come, that be threatned and due. And in verie reaſon we muſt needes ſee it muſt bee ſo, for ſinne or tranſgreſſion of the lawe beeing as it is, an offence againſt the almightie, and ſo a meanes direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to deſerue the ſeueritie of his iuſtice, to be ſhewed againſt the ſame, who is ſo ſimple but he muſt needes ſee, that all miſeries in this life, and eternall death and damnation in the life to come, are but iuſty threatned againſt all that breake the law? Nowe theſe thinges thus beeing, may we thinke that thoſe beeing both due and threatned, that the infinite iuſtice of GOD is ſuch that it will not inflict or execute the ſame, when or vpon whome he liſt? To what end tende all the fearefull examples of Gods vengeance executed vppon men, that wee reade of in the ſcriptures and in other bookes, and daily ſeeby expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, but to teach vs that God is not a bare threatner, but that he both can and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:2586:21"/>wilbe as ſeuere as his threatnings come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, if there be not a iuſt and ſufficient ſtop to ſtay the fierceneſſe of his iuſt wrath from breaking out againſt all the generation of mankind? Yf al this will not ſerue to make vs haue broken and contrite heartes for our ſinnes, and ſo to hunger and thirſt after Chriſt, let vs further yet behold the vglineſſe of our ſinnes, and the extreeme danger that we were in, by the meanes of them; in this that God hath not ſpared his onely begotten ſonne, to giue him to vs, to be borne and to liue and die for vs, as he did. For heerein, as <hi>the loue and bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of our God towardes man, hath moſt gloriouſly appeared,</hi> (as <hi>Paule</hi> noteth, <hi>Titus</hi> 3.4.) ſo therein, and thereof we may ſay with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>that mercy and iuſtice haue moſt notably mette and kiſt each other, Pſal.</hi> 85.10. for doubtleſſe ſuch was the loue of the father towardes the ſonne, that if in his wiſedome any other phiſition, or any other meanes, could or woulde haue ſerued to haue recouered and cured vs of our ſinnes, he woulde neuer haue ſo farre debaſed his ſonne, as beeing God, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point him to become man, and in his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode to haue endured, liuing, and dying for vs, that which he did.

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:2586:22"/>and moſt ſurely ready we cannot tell how ſoone, to deſtroy vs, if it be not ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this our mediatour Ieſus Chriſt, as that hereby our heartes breake and rente a ſunder for ſorrowe, we make euident demonſtration, that we are more blockiſh and ſenceleſſe, than theſe ſenceleſſe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, &amp; ſo we ſhal proue that we are none of thoſe to whome Chriſt here ſpeaketh. But if here by as <hi>Ioel</hi> hath taught vs <hi>Cap.</hi> 2. <hi>ver.</hi> 13. we take occaſion to rent our hearts and not our garments, and ſo to hunger and thirſt aright for comforte from Chriſt, then whatſoeuer we haue beene before, of Chriſt it hath beene ſaid vnto vs, both for good direction herein, and euerlaſting comforte, <hi>A bruſed reed ſhall he not breake, and ſmoking flaxe ſhall he not quench, Eſaie</hi> 42.3. when the Lorde therefore by reading or preaching of his worde, or by any other meanes that it ſhal pleaſe him to vſe to that purpoſe, bringeth all theſe, or any of theſe, to our remembrance, then we are to make our reckoning, that of his good grace &amp; fauor therby he giues vs iuſt occaſion ſo to ſee our ſins, that in the ſight &amp; feeling of the burthen therof, we ſhould thus hunger &amp; thirſt after him, that through him we might be deliuered from them.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:2586:23"/>And the more and better we dwell vpon the mediation of theſe fower thinges, the Lord withall opening our eyes and heartes rightlie to vnderſtand them, and the vſe thereof to this ende, the more forcible we ſhall finde them to worke this effect. But the trueth is, through our originall ſin, we haue brought with vs into the world, ſuch a generall forwardneſſe to all euill, and backwardneſſe to all good, ioyned with ſuch groſſe blindneſſe in thinges ſpirituall, and by actuall ſinnes daily flowing from this bitter fountaine in vs, we haue al of vs, ſo hardned our owne heartes, that though the Lord by ſounding theſe thinges out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardlie in our eares, may make vs without all excuſe, if hereby we take no occaſion thus to be humbled before him, yet moſt certaine is it that the hearing of theſe things neuer ſo often outwardlie beaten vpon, will neuer prooue forcible and effectual inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to breede in vs, this true ſpiritual hunger and thirſt, vntill the Lorde himſelfe of his ſpeciall fauoure and grace, both open the eyes of our mindes, and mollifie and ſof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten our hard heartes, and ſo indeede him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe by his owne hand and power, heereby worke this in vs. This taught <hi>Moſes</hi> the Iewes, ſaying, <hi>yet the Lord hath not giuen

For when we haue the due ſence and feeling in deed of our ſinnes, that we ought to haue before euer we will ſeek after Chriſt as we ſhould; we will and muſt (as I haue ſhewed before) be vndoubtedly wearie thereof, and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to be eaſd of the moſt heauie burden of them.

And the meanes whereby he moſt preuaileth heerein, be, ignorance, ſecurity, and errour. By ignorance, hee preuaileth with all thoſe, be they Iewes, Turkes, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes, or whatſoeuer, whom by any cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning he can keepe in ignorance, eyther of the lawe, perſon, or office of Chriſt, of which ſort wonderfull manie be. By ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:2586:25"/>he preuaileth, not onely alſo with the former, but likewiſe ſhamfully with the carnall goſpellers, beguiling their heartes being as yet indeed, for all their faire out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſhewe in words, quite voyde of al true loue and delight, either in the law or goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, through the deceitfulnes of ſinne, and by teaching of them to turne the grace of God into wantonnes, and moſt lewdly to abuſe the mercies of God in Chriſt, by preſuming therby to haue their ſinnes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen them, when and howe they liſte: though they as longe as they liſt continue therein. By errour alſo he preuaileth migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilie with verie many, and nowe a daies wonderfully amongſt the papiſtes. For as though directly they had conſpired with fathan to keepe men from euerhauing that hunger and thirſt after Chriſt that I haue proued to be moſt neceſſary (notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the great light that ſhineth in the world and diſcouereth and detecteth their dealing herin to be too too bad) they haue ſet abroach, and defend a number of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, which can lead to no better, or other end, but toblunt and to dull the edge (very greatly at the leaſt), of alſuch hungring and thirſting after Chriſt. For to what other, or better end ſerueth, either their refuſing
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:2586:26"/>to ioyne with vs, or their teaching as they doe, in the doctrines of original ſinne, and mans free will in things ſpirituall and good? with vs they will not holde, that originall ſinne, is ſuch an vniuerſall inbred and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne corruption, and priuitie in man where by, not onely it is euident that <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, is imputed vnto him, and that the guiltines thereof therefore is his, withall the other bad fruites, and conſequentes thereof, but alſo amongſt all other, this, that naturally, euen by the force and power thereof he is altogether in al the powers both of his body and ſoule corrupted and prone to all euill, and backward, to euery thing that is good: but to the full conſtitution of the nature thereof, they hold, that it is inough to ſay it is either a want of originall righteouſneſſe, which, ought to be in vs, or an habituall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion from God, which they hold to be but ſuch, as that therewith may and doth in ſome yet ſtand, mans free will to good, &amp; that it is ſo quite taken away and aboliſhed in the baptiſme of euery one, that thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth there remaines not, (though concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence remaine ſtill) anie reliques there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of at all, or cauſe why man ſhould be grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued either at or with the feeling therof as at, or with ſin. And ſuch frewil is it which they
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:2586:26"/>hold man hath after his fall, euen to and in that which is ſpirituall &amp; good, as that man in his firſt conuerſion to God, hauing but the outward means thereof ſufficiently of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred vnto him, that euen that grace is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to conuert him, if he would himſelfe, which they holde he might, if he liſt: and being once conuerted, that is (as they take it) the outward meanes being once ſo fully and effectually proferred him, as where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he taketh occaſion rightly to vſe his fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, in accepting of grace ſo offered: then they holde by the meanes of grace ther vpon beſtowed vpon him (which they count and call the habit of charitie) he can will freely, and worke any good thing. Whereas wee (as we haue often ſhewed) enforced both by the ſcriptures, fathers, reaſon, and all experience, confeſſe and teach, that by the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> our freewill to and in that which is good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, is ſo loſt as that, what good meanes ſo euer, at any time be outwardly preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto vs, yet thereby we ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be able to will well, by any power left in vs, nor euer ſhall indeede vnleſſe GOD inwardlie, by his ſpirite withall, firſt create and frame in euerie one of vs a new heart and will, to chooſe that which

Who may not therefore, euen hereby plainlie ſee, that fathan mightily preuaileth by their doctrine to holde men backe from hungring and thirſtinge after Chriſte, as they ſhoulde? For if originall ſinne bring no deeper nor vniuerſaller corruption with it then they teache it doth, into the nature of man, and may and is ſo quickely and vtterly aboliſhed out of the ſame againe by baptiſme, and man hath in him ſelfe remaining ſuch a free will to good, that before his conuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, vpon the offering of the outward means thereof ſufficiently he may be conuerted, if he wil himſelfe, and that after he needs no daily or further ſupplie of the ſpirit to leade his wil alwaies therevnto, but that which he receiued in his firſt conuerſion, to worke together with the natiue or hereditarie free will that was before in man: then ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what is there left, either by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of our originall ſinne, or by the viewe of our lacke of free will to good, an inſeperable companion thereof, to make vs to long and to thirſt after Chriſt? For by their doctrine, if we bee but baptized, we are quite rid and freede
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:2586:27"/>from the former, and as for the latter we haue it naturallie ſo, as yet it is not quite taken from vs by <hi>Adams</hi> fall, but onely by our ſinnes originall and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, ſo ſettred and hindred that either vpon ſufficient meanes, but outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offered, we may vſe it againe, euen to the accepting thereof, to our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion, or after, but by vertue of grace receiued at once in our conuerſion, for euer then vſe and ſhewe it free to the working out of our owne ſaluation. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter baptiſme then you ſee, they hold it needleſſe for a man to trouble: his conſcience with originall ſinne, or any parte thereof, and to deliuer the other out of captiuitie, where into it is brought by ſinne, that ſo (as ſome of them ſpeake) they may goe with the owne foote thereof, and flie with the owne winges and feathers thereof, which it had before, though it coulde not vſe them; there is no more in effect to doe, but to haue the outwarde meanes ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cientlie profered, for that euen therevpon, if man wil vſe his free will, (as they ſay he may doe, if he will) all the reſt touching the full freedome there of, wil follow. Their doctrine alſo of ſatiſfying for our ſinnes,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:2586:28"/>by our ſelues and others, of the force and validitie of indulgences maſſes, and ſuch like thinges purchaſed for vs, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe either by our ſelues, or others, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whiles we are aliue or dead, and their conceptes of purgatory, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe of ſoules there, by a number of things, which they ſeeke to make men beleeue, will ſerue well, to that end, of the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus merits, and ſatiſfactions of others to be communicated to ſuch as lacke, either through the common force of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of ſaintes, or by the ſpeciall inten<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion of the doer and ſufferrer of them, or of the ordinarie diſpoſer thereof at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure (which they hold to be the pope) and of their mediation and interceſſion of ſaints and Angels, for their deuout worſhippers and callers vpon: are as it were ſo manie ſtrong cables, to holde men backe either altogether, or in great parte, from long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and thirſting at all after Chriſt. Laſtlie their doctrine hath been and is ſuch, to blunt the edge and force of the law, which God hath left, as I haue ſhewed, righthe vnderſtood, to driue men herunto, that in verie deed they haue left it, as it is and muſt bee vnderſtood, by their gloſes and additions, and detractions about the ſame,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:2586:28"/>without any force at all in effect, to this purpoſe. For firſt at their pleaſure they leaue out the ſecond commaundemente, and to make yet vp the number of 10. they deuide the laſt into two:: ſecondly though <hi>Dauid</hi> neuer ſo much magnifie the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection thereof as we haue heard, <hi>Pſal:</hi> 19.7. yet it ſhall be ſo imperfect with them, as that there are 5. commandements more, which they call the commaun lements of the church, beſide infinite other traditions, for the obſeruing whereof often times, they make the commandements of God of noe effect, as the phariſes did for theirs, which muſt needs be obſerued, ſay they, or elſe a man cannot lead ſuch a holy chriſtian life, as he ſhould: thirdly they are ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident &amp; reſolute, that it is poſſible for man to keepe the lawe of God, that they haue curſed al that hold the contrarie, they teach a man may doe that &amp; more alſo, and that God were a very tirant, if man coulde not keep &amp; fulfil his law. Yea herm they haue gon ſo far as that not onely they hold, that a man may in euery point ſo exactly keep it, that he can neither be charged with tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſgreſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dment therin contayned, nor yet in iuſtice be debarred from the wages &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde of ſaluation which by perfect kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:2586:29"/>thereof, he hath merited and deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. Which whiles they teach and doe, firſt they make ſome negligent and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, in ſtudying and meditating of the lawe to the purpoſe aforeſaid, ſeeing by them they are occaſioned, to thinke that man may adde therevnto, and take from thence at his pleaſure, and ſo by this means the law ſtands theſe in no ſteed, to this end: and ſecondly by their laſt kind of doctrine hereof, whereas both the nature of the law it ſelfe, and all the circumſtances vſed by God in the firſt promulgation thereof, plain<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly ſhew, that by Gods ordinance it was and is appointed to make man to tremble and quake, at the ſight of his manifold &amp; greate ſins &amp; imperfections therby made known vnto him, that ſo therby he might take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, the ſooner and the more earneſtlie to ſeeke to be made righteous by Chriſt, and to haue that vnrighteouſneſs of his owne, pardoned &amp; couered, they haue quite tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed &amp; altered the vſe therof, as though it were giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God of purpoſe ſtrongly to lead man, to a ſtrong conceit of his own ablenes to keep &amp; fulfil the ſame, &amp; ſo conſequently therby to an opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that either Chriſt is not very much to be thirſted for at al, or elſe, that one may very quickly haue done with
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:2586:29"/>him. Their rule, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, borrowed from <hi>Plutarch,</hi> that is, lawes muſt be made according to mans ability to keepe them, will not beare out and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie this their opinion of mans ableneſſe nowe to keepe the lawe. For it is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for clearing of God of all blame herein, as I haue ſhewed before, that man as he created him at the firſt, was able to keepe this lawe, which now both plaine and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull experience, and the expreſſe ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelfe, ſaith it is impoſſible for him to doe, through the weakneſſe of the fleſh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. For what reaſon is there, ſeeing man is fallen from his abilitie, by his owne follie, eyther that God therefore ſhoulde fall, or alter in his rule of righteouſneſſe, or that he may not challenge that at his handes, that in reſpect of his creation, and otherwiſe he owes him, though he know well inough before hand, that he is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to pay him one of a thouſand? Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, ſeeing man may make this moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and profitable vſe thereof, euen ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to take occaſion to ſee from what he is fallen, and to what, that ſo he may giue ouer, euer truſting to come to heauen, by keeping of the law, whereof he is ſo great a breaker, that he may ſeeke and truſt only
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:2586:30"/>to come thither, by beleeuing the goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt. To maintaine yet the fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie of mans abilitie and poſſibilitie to keep the law, they haue deuiſed a number of ſhiftes, all which alſo tende to the quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſpirituall hunger and thirſt after Chriſt. For to this end ſome of them haue taught, that the preciſe, full, and perfect ſence of the law, is not for vs heere in the way to our country, but when we come there, and that here we may be ſaide to haue kept it, though in an inferiour and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfecter ſence: other ſome thinke, and haue written, that man may be ſaide to be a keeper and fulfiller of the law, when for the moſt part he doth ſo, but others miſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of both theſe, as not pregnant inough to aduance mans abilitie, and the facility or eaſines of the law, teach plainly that the iuſtified man, or man in the ſtate of grace findeth the lawe of GOD, in his moſt perfecte ſence, an eaſie yooke for him to beare and to vndergoe, for that by grace his is enabled perfectly to keepe and fulfill it all, in euery pointe, euen here. And yet in deede theſe luſtie lads, for all this, for that by experience they finde that ſaying of <hi>Iames. In many things we ſinne all. Cha.</hi> 3.2. verified in them, euen
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:2586:30"/>when they thinke themſelues to be in that ſtate, and for that they finde like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that Sainte <hi>Paul</hi> in that ſtate in deede, yet complaineth of concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence, which he founde in himſelfe, by comparing himſelfe with the lawe, that was &amp; is ſpirituall, holye, and good, and ſheweth that moſt gladly he woulde be rid thereof. <hi>Romaines</hi> 7.7. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Are faine to helpe out this their poſition, with this, that thoſe ſinnes whereof <hi>Iames</hi> ſpeakes, and others, of men in that caſe, are but veniall ſinnes, and that the firſt motions to ſinne, or concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence founde in the regenerate after baptiſme, are not ſinne.

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:2586:31"/>ſaying the Lordes prayer, by faſting a day, by an almes giuing, by generall confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſinnes, or by a Biſhops bleſſing, yea, as one ſaith, though theſe be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any inward good motion at all: Yea, if all theſe will not ſerue, their great <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> will not yet be put, or driuen from this poſition, of the ableneſſe of man to keepe the lawe: For after he had tried, with other of his fellowes, what theſe coulde doe, to wipe away the obiections made againſt the ſame, preſſing <hi>Paules</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience to the contrarie. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. though it be there neuer ſo plaine, that by the law euen then he found himſelf a breaker of the lawe, and therefore no perfect keeper ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, yet for that <hi>Paule</hi> there, to comfort him ſelfe with all, confeſſeth that in his mind, or inward man he delighted in the lawe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed of that which was good, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned the contrarie, he ſayeth that in ſo ſaying <hi>Paule</hi> prooues and ſhewes, that he was, for all the lawe in his members, which likewiſe he ſaith rebelled againſt the lawe of his minde, and led him captiue vnto the lawe of ſinne, a perfect keeper euen then of the lawe. For the lawe ſaith he, is not giuen to the ſence or fleſh, but to the minde and ſpirit of man, wherein <hi>Paule</hi>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:2586:31"/>kept the lawe, though in the other reſpect he had ſuch cauſe to complaine. And whereas he knewe that ſuch as they counte no veniall, but deadly ſinnes haue beene found, and may be againe, euen in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, yet ſuch he will defend, may be counted perfect keepers of the lawe, when they haue riſen againe by repentance, and haue had thoſe their ſinnes forgiuen in Chriſt. Yea though he be enforced by a place out of Saint <hi>Auguſtines</hi> firſt booke of his retractions, <hi>Cap.</hi> 19. to confeſſe, that there is aduouched by him, ſome imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in the beſt mens keeping of the lawe, yet to doe the beſt that he coulde, to couer and cure the wounde that, that ſaying had giuen his cauſe, he would make his reader beleeue, that the imperfection that he findes therein, is but <hi>Carentia per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionis,</hi> the want of perfection, and not the tranſgreſſion of any one commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which he reſembled to the omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of one letter, in writing of much. If this be learnedlie to defende a poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or the maintenance thereof not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to fall into ſo manie abſurdities, as theſe be, and then beſides to be driuen to vſe ſuch a ſort of friuolous, and fruitles ſhiftes as theſe be, what poſition can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:2586:32"/>to be fooliſh, and falſe, but that a man of any wit may defende it? And who can be ſo ſimple and blinde, but he muſt needs perceiue, that in all this geare, whether they ſee it or not, that Sathan directly by their mouthes and pens, laboreth and ſweateth moſt egerly, and directly, to make men ſo drunken and full with a conceite of their owne perfection, or at leaſt ſmall imperfection, that they hunger nor thirſt after Chriſt, as they haue cauſe in deede to doe, Who but men bewitched with an opinion, that whatſoeuer their Romain prelates alow for currant and found do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, how contrary ſo euer it be in deede to ſcriptures, fathers, reaſon, and all, would euer hold, either al or any of theſe? For moſt plentifully, by all theſe, a number of times wee haue ſhewed them, their vanitie and folly, in all of theſe, and to this daie they neither haue, nor euer will be able to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere vs to the purpoſe herein. And aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure thyſelfe that herein I haue charged them with nothing, but with that, which I finde, in the beſt and moſt famous writers of their ſide, as namely in <hi>Andra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius, Oſorious, Caniſius Vega, Franſciſcus de victoria,</hi> the cenſure of <hi>Colen,</hi> their Rhemiſh notes of the new teſtament, and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:2586:32"/>in <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> But, howſoeuer, therfore they may ſtand reſſolute herein, yet I hope euen the bare recitall hereof, maketh thee Chriſtian reader, to ſee the verie groſſe abſurditie thereof alſo. If there were noe more to cauſe thee to ſee it, but this, that the reſt of all theſe their doctrines plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye tendes and is, as I haue ſhewed, to driue man either to thinke his ſoules ſicknes through ſinne, not to be ſo daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and grieuous as it is indeede, and therefore as we teach it to bee, or for his recouery thereof to truſt to other phiſick or Phiſitions, then to the onely phiſition of our ſoules Chriſt Ieſus euen that ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye were and is ſufficient. For how can that doctrine be any way found or good, that naturally bringeth forth or breedeth eyther of theſe curſed fruites, ſo dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to mans ſaluation, or ſo iniurious to the honour and glorie of Chriſt Ieſus? Yet that thou maiſt not be without thy particular counterpoyſon in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, againſt euery one of theſe their poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to Iuſtifie our doctrine, and to confute theirs: touching original ſin &amp; free will, remember that with vs, againſt them it is written touching the former thus; The imagination of mans hart is only cuil, euen
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:2586:33"/>from youth. <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 8.21. <hi>the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall man perceiueth not the thinges of the ſpiritte of God, neither can he knowe them.</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.4. Yea that before our conuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we are ſaid to haue hard and ſtonie heartes, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 11.19. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.5. but alſo to be darkneſſe. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.8. and dead by ſinne. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.5. and that touching the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Paule</hi> hath moſt plainely taught the Saintes at <hi>Phillippis,</hi> that it was God that wrought in them, both the will and the worke, and that of his owne good pleaſure, <hi>Cap.</hi> 2.13. and that Chriſt himſelfe moſt plainely hath ſaid, <hi>that no man can come vnto him but whom the father draweth. Ioh.</hi> 6.44. <hi>and that without him we can doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Iohn.</hi> 15.5. And their next three are ſufficiently confuted, euen in that we read, and we knowe it is moſt certaine that our Chriſt is able perfectly to ſaue al them that come vnto God by him, ſeeing he euer li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth to make interceſſion for them. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. and hath offered himſelfe once for all to take away the ſinnes of many, <hi>Cap.</hi> 9.28 yea with that one offering, hath conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for euer them that are ſanctified, 10.14. eſpecially it beeing alſo moſt plainely writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as it is, that as there is but one God, ſo there is but one mediatour betwixt God
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:2586:33"/>and man the man Chriſt Ieſus, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. and that there is no other allowed doore, whereby at all to enter into Gods ſheepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folde, but onely the ſame Chriſt Ieſus, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 10.1.9. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For theſe places are moſt pregnant to cut the throte for euer of all thoſe deuiſes, and may ſatisfie, and will anie, that are not wilfullie diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to wraſtle, for the aduauncing of the creature and his owne founde de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe, though to the darkening and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcuring of the creator, our bleſſed God and ſauiour for euer. Nowe laſthe, in as fewe wordes as I can, to arme thee, that thou take no harme by that which they teach touching the lawe, and the keeping thereof. Firſt to ouerthrow their maine grounde therein, remember and marke well that <hi>Peter</hi> in the firſt famouſe councell at <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> ſpeaking of the lawe, openlie and confidentlie pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces it to be a burthen, which neyther they nor their forefathers were able to beare. <hi>Act.</hi> 15.10. and that the refore <hi>Paule</hi> hath proued that no man can be iuſtified, by his keeping of the lawe, becauſe it is written, curſed is euerie one that continueth not in all thinges, which are written in the booke of the law,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:2586:34"/>to doe them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16. For theſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces will ſtande in force, for all <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines,</hi> and his fellowes cauilling, and ſeeking by their Romiſh ſophiſtrie to wipe away the ſame, to the full and direct confutation of this their opinion, that it is poſſible, and alſo found true by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience (for otherwiſe they ſay nothing, for we diſpute not, as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaide in this caſe,
<note place="margin">Lib. 2. cap. 6. de pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatorum meritis.</note> what God can doe, but what he doth) that a regenerate man, ſhoulde perfectly keepe the lawe. For neither was the queſtion that they had in hand in that councell, onely of the keeping of the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall and iudiciall lawe of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> but of keeping therewith alſo the whole lawe, as it appeares by the ſetting downe of the ſame, and the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances thereof, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 5. neyther was the lawe, nor is it, anie other waie a yooke or burthen, which neyther they nor their fathers were able to beare, but as therein eſpecially is compriſed the lawe morall, which rightly vnderſtoode, mans weakeneſſe conſidered, is infinite har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to keepe for man, then both the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And for <hi>Paule</hi> in the other place, to haue graunted onely this, that no man by his owne ſtrength without
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:2586:34"/>faith and grace can keepe the whole law, would not, nor coulde not, haue ſerned his turne, to any purpoſe to confute thoſe that he dealt withal. For neither were the falſe Apoſtles ſo fooliſh to teach, or the <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> once ſo ſillie or ſimple, as to be but in daunger to beleeue, that any ſuch works of the lawe, ſo done, were at all to be truſted vnto, to erne or merit their ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by. And therefore as it cannot be denied, but that he ſpeaketh there of the lawe in generall (as his wordes, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not in all thinges, which are written in the booke of the lawe, doe ſhewe) ſo may it not, nor cannot, without wilfull cauilling, that the propoſition, that he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumeth, as granted, and ſuch as might not be denied was this, that certaine it is, no man continueth in all the thinges that are written in the lawe, to doe them, whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer he bee. For thereupon it muſt and doth onely follow, that ſuch as theſe were that he reaſoned againſt, that put truſt and confidence in the works of the law, which they did after faith, and in grace, coulde not be iuſtified thereby: becauſe the lawe found them yet in ſome thinges breakers thereof, and therefore was ſo farre of from iuſtifying of them, for keeping
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:2586:35"/>it in parte, that he pronounced them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed for not keeping it, in whole and in enery point. And yet <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſeemes to perſwade himſelf, that he hath clenlie ſhilted of the former place, by telling vs that <hi>Peter</hi> ſo ſpoke of the lawe, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the ceremonies thereof, and the iudicialles thereunto appertayning onelie, and that alſo he hath quite ridde his handes of the other, by aſſuming a propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition about ſuch workes of the lawe, as were yet neuer in queſtion there, betwixt him and anie of his aduerſaries. Thus then the piller of theirs throwne downe and laide in the duſt, with it are all the reſt that depend thereon, ouerthrowne alſo. Notwithſtanding, briefely let vs take a view of them, the better to vnderſtand the vanitie and impiety therein ſet downe. That the perfect and exact ſenſe of the law is rather for men in heauen then in earth, how can it be, ſeeing moſt of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes are ſuch, as concerne onely this life? our Sabaoth is perpetuall, and not one day in the ſeauen, and what diſtinction of degrees amongſt vs are to be imagined there, that we ſhould reade the fifth commaundement? Yea what neede ſhall then be there to haue any of the other
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:2586:35"/>preſcribed vs, where there is no danger at all, or feare to be had of loſſe of life, hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, goods, or name? As for the next gloſe wherbyſom would haue men to be cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted keepers &amp; fulfillers of the law, for keeping it in the moſt part, Iames hath moſt planily taught, ſaying, <hi>whoſoeuer ſhall keep the whole law, and yet faileth in one point, he is guilty of all. Cap.</hi> 2. <hi>Ver.</hi> 10. Now other of them ſay that grace makes the whole eaſie to be kept, it is eaſier ſaide, then any way proued to be ſo, for that all experience of ſuch as haue had grace, in as good meaſure, as any againe can hope to haue it, hath beene euer yet moſt flat to the contrary. Yet we eaſily graunt, that to men in grace, it is far eaſier then to any other, yea and that it is eaſie to them in this reſpect, that they vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fainedly ſtudying and endeauouring to keep it, though ſomtimes they faile &amp; com ſhort thereof, yet thereby taking occaſion to repent, and ſo by faith, to ſeeke to the fountaine of grace, Chriſt Ieſus, for pardon, they finde him moſt able and willing to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count their purpoſe and care to haue kepte it, euen inſteede of the fulfilling therof in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, to pardon &amp; purge them of all their a berrations from the ſame. But where is all this, to proue man any time, to be ſo
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:2586:36"/>full and perfect a keeper thereof, that he neyther may be charged with the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of any one commaundement, nor in iuſtice debarred from the wages of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen which he hath merited and deſerued thereby? And yet thus farre they goe in this pointe, though quite without war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent or ground. For though this were gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them, that after regeneration, ſome thus coulde and did keepe the lawe, yet where finde they that God hath bounde himſelfe by any promiſe, to giue heauen to any for keeping his lawe, onely in ſome part, or for ſome peece of his life. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the promiſe that God hath made of life, or reward to the keepers of his law, is, if they, during their whole life whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, obſerue the ſame, otherwiſe hee hath promiſed them nothing, but a curſe, as we haue heard before. But to let this paſſe, and to proceede, their next helpes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuges are, that which they holde of veniall ſinnes, and of concupiſcence, and of the firſt motions to ſinne not conſented vnto: wherein they ere many waies. For firſt it is great boldneſſe in them to ſay where <hi>Iames</hi> or any other ſay, in mancy thinges we ſin al, that there they meane only their veniall ſinnes: Where experience told dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie

For what perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were there in the rule of righteouſneſſe preſcribed therein, if it left ſuch a number of ſins vncheckt, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred? That they all ſhould be but at the omitting of a letter in writing of much, or as ſome others haue ſaid, but as a few ſmall motes in a faire garment, and therfore to be pardoned, either for their own littlenes, or to be wiped clean away by ſuch trifling means, as they to that end, ſay wil ſerue it is ſtrange that any that haue any knowledge of God, or his iuſtice, or of his written word, ſhould either ſo ſay or thinke. For who knowes not, that God requires the whole heart, &amp; ſoule of man, and that al the faculties and powers, both of body and ſoule, ſhoulde whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſerue him, and that as hee himſelfe

And yet many of theſe, if not all, they muſt needes confeſſe, be ſuch as they count but veniall ſmnes. Let not any man therefore, liften vnto theſe men, thus ſeeking to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate the vilenes and heauines of any ſin, how ſmall ſoeuer: but rather let euery one learne of Chriſt to account the ſmaleſt ſin
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:2586:37"/>that he falleth into, in thought, word, or countenaunce, damnable inough of it own nature, if God lay it to the charge of the committer thereof. That concupiſcence or the firſt motions to ſinne, ariſing in our minde, are not ſinne, may, I woulde thinke, appeare ſufficiently to be falſe, in that <hi>Paule</hi> ſo complaineth thereof, as he doth, and woulde ſo ſaine be rid of it, as we reade <hi>Romans.</hi> 7.7.17.24. and that expreſly it is forbid in the laſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

For there is no probabilitie, that the Lorde of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſetting downe the ſumme of his law, ſo breeflie as he doth in theſe 10 com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes of his, and diſtinguiſhing it into 10. expreſly, as he doth, <hi>Deut:</hi> 4.10. that either he would forbid one thing often, or confounde one commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the matter thereof with an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, which of neceſſitie muſt be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted yet to be ſo, vnleſſe for the diſtinction of this laſt commandement from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:2586:38"/>we ſay, that therein bare and naked vnlawfulluſt or concupiſcence, though not conſented vnto, is expreſly condemned, and in the other, the ſame yealded and conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto. And thus it ſeemeth, <hi>Paule</hi> tooke it, and vnderſtood it, in ſayinge he had not knowne luſt, (meaning that it is ſinne) but that the law ſaith, <hi>thou ſhalt not luſt: Romains</hi> 7.7. and there vpon doubtleſſe he is driuen to acknowledge as he doth there, the lawe to be ſpirituall, and himſelfe vnable to anſwere in his fleſh the perfection thereof. And God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, as I ſaid before, and as we are taught by the ſumme an abridgement of the law, often repeated in the ſcriptures, that we ſhoulde loue him with our whole heart, and our neighbour as our ſelfe, howe can our heartes be wholie his, when there are but theſe firſt filthie motions to ſinne, neuer ſo little a while flying vp and downe there. Wherefore if ſinne be as <hi>Iohn</hi> hath defined it, the tranſgreſſion of the law, 3.4. and hereby the verie life of the lawe and the ſubſtance thereof be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, as doubtleſſe it is, howe can it be, but that bare luſt, and the firſt euill moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to ſinne, though by and by reſiſted, are ſinne, and that ſimplie and properlie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Who therefore of any wiſedom or learning, would haue thought that ſuch a beggerly and fond anſwere as this, would haue ſerued, to haue clean daſht &amp; anſwered, ſuch an inuincible argument, as he takes vpon him to anſwere herewith? And as for his other 2. they are verie ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous. For what is it to proue, that the keeping of the lawe, is poſſible to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, to ſay, that if thay fall into any mortall ſinne, repenting therof, and hauing the ſame forgiuen, then they are counted ſtill as keepers therof? For this is not by their meritte and perfect keeping of the law, but by the grace of the goſpel, which offereth
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:2586:39"/>pardon to theſe that repent, though they haue traſgreſſed the lawe.

And as in deed, in other poore la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hours of mine already in print, I haue ſhewed, the ancient fathers are moſt plaine and pregnant in this, to ſhow, that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of our righteouſnes, lyeth rather in the ſight of our own manifolde vnrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes, to vrge vs to thirſt after the making of vs righteous, through the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes of Chriſt Ieſus, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in any finding at any time, of any perfect inherent righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, in our ſelues. Wherefore theſe thinges conſidered, I truſt you will rather vſe the meanes before laide before you by mee, according to Gods worde, to breede

            <p>The next thing beere to be conſidered of,
<note place="margin">The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mande ment. which containes 2. things. b. what it is to come vnto Chriſt.</note> is the commandementes here giuen by Chriſt, vnto ſuch as I haue ſpoken of and haue laboured to make all you where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in as I ſaide in the beginning, he requireth of all ſuch, two thinges, namely that they ſhoulde come vnto him and then drinke of him, where by comming vnto him, we haue not, as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> hath noted in his 26. and 32 tractes vpon <hi>Iohn,</hi> to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand a comming vnto him by the feete of the bodie. For ſo manie came vnto him, touched him, and througed him, and yet were neuer the better. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.31. but a comming vnto him, by the direction of the eies of the ſoule, by the feete of ſound knowledge of him, what he is in perſon, and what he is in office. When this worde is vſed alone as <hi>Mat:</hi> 11.28. in thoſe wordes of his, <hi>come vnto me, all ye that be wearie and heauie laden, and I will eaſe you,</hi> then thereby doubtleſſe we
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:2586:40"/>haue not onely to vnderſtand, thus much, but that therby further is required of vs, faith in him, grounded vpon this our knowledge of him, as vpon the foundation thereof. But wher it is coupled with other wordes, that either expreſly, or in effect call for faith, as it is here, then thus as I haue ſaid, it is to be taken, as <hi>Iohn.</hi> 6.40. compared with this place makes it euident. For there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteed of comming vnto him, he ſaith he that ſeeth the ſonne, not vnderſtanding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, the ſeeing of him, with bodily eies, but with ſpirituall: and then he goeth on, ſaying, <hi>and beleeueth in him, ſhall haue euerlaſting life.</hi> Wherefore, vntill by the light of the goſpell, men haue ſo profited, through the inward working of Gods holy ſpirite in them, that they knowe and acknowledge Chriſt aright, both in perſon and office they haue nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eies not feete in Chriſtes ſence, here, to come vnto him by or withall. Pray we therefore for this light, and the countenance thereof amongſt vs. For certainely the naturall man perceiues not the thinges of God, neither can he, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are ſpirituall. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11.14. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But they that haue the light of the goſpell ſhinning amongſt them, though

And yet I feare there is ſuch bad and ſmale co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to Chriſt, ſound amongſt vs, that he in reſpect of moſt of vs, hath too too iuſt cauſe to ſay vnto vs, as he did to the <hi>Iewes</hi> in his time, <hi>This is the conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nation, that light is come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, &amp; men loue darknes better then light becauſe their deeds are euil.

Iohn.</hi> 12.31.36. But that this his aduiſe and counſell may be in time, and that effectually taken to heart, and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of vs, in this caſe in walking aright vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt by the direction of this light, whiles it ſhines amongſt vs, we are ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our owne vnableneſſe other wiſe ſo to doe at all to be as it is, to pray him accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his promiſe made to his diſciples, <hi>that he woulde alſo praie his father to beſtow vpon vs euen the ſpirite of trueth, to teach vs all thinges. Iohn.</hi> 14.16.17.26. <hi>and to leade vs vnto all truthe.</hi> 16.13. For if euer we attaine by this light, to the ſound and perfect knowledge of Ieſus Chriſt, wherein euen the wiſedome of God in a myſterie, as <hi>Paule</hi> ſpeaketh, is contained. 1. <hi>Cor:</hi> 2.7. doubtleſſe we ſhall haue cauſe with him to ſay further, as he doth there alſo <hi>Ver:</hi> 10.11.

            <p>Seeing then that Chriſt commaundeth vs here to come vnto him and to come vnto him is nothing elſe, but according to the light of the goſpell, directing vs therein, by his ſpirite to be enabled, rightly to knowe him, acknowledge and confeſſe him, it ſtan deth vs vpon diligently to marke and to con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſider, howe therein he is deſcribed and ſet forth vnto vs. Which if we doe, we ſhall ſoone finde,

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:2586:42"/>world, and yet in the vnity of Godhead, that there are 3. diſtinct perſons, the father, the ſon, and the holy ghoſt, coequal &amp; coeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall: the light of the goſpell makes it moſt cleare &amp; euident, that the 2. perſons in this trinitie, hauing been fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euerlaſting, &amp; then alſo being true &amp; very God, when the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of time was come, he tooke vnto him ſelfe the full and whole nature of man in the wombe of the bleſſed virgine <hi>Marie,</hi> that by the power of the holy ghoſt ſhadow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing her, ſhe both conceiued and bare a ſon, (remaining ſtil a virgine) that was &amp; is very God and man alſo, &amp; yet not two perſons bur one.

In which alſo, ſo much as I haueſaid, touching his perſon, is taught, for therin we finde him termed the ſon of the almighty &amp; <hi>Emanuel,</hi> that is, God with vs: &amp; to proue that he was conceiued &amp; born of the virgin his mother, a very man, there his petegree

               </gap> that is, one exiſting and being in the forme of God: and after it is added, that euen this ſame tooke vnto himſelf the forme of a ſeruant.

For as his being in the forme of man, proued, that he was a verie man, &amp; yet a diſtinct perſon in that nature from other men, equal with them in the common nature: ſo his being in the forme of God, and his iuſt and lawfull thinking (which doubtles it was, or elſe it coulde not haue been incident to ſuch an one) that it was no wrong, or robery to be equal with God, proues moſt ſubſtantially, that he was before his incarnation by nature very God, &amp; equal to his father as touching his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, though a diſtinct perſon from his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For who can be in the forme of God, but verie God, &amp; who can think it no robe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry &amp; that rightly, to be equall to God, but he that indeed is coequal to &amp; with God, &amp; yet how can theſe things be ſaid, and ſaid truely, as certainly they be here, of the ſon of God, but they muſt needs proue, that though father, ſon, &amp; holy ghoſt, be all but one God, and haue but one eſſence, &amp; that moſt perfectly one, that yet the ſame is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct perſon from the perſon of the father?
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:2586:44"/>For one &amp; ſelf ſame perſon cannot be ſaid to be equal to it ſelf: he therfore that thinketh it no robery to be equal, muſt needs be one perſon, &amp; he to whom he accounts himſelfe equal, an other. So that with this one ſhort ſentence, &amp; with theſe verie fewe wordes, as it were with one blow, all theſe heretiques, <hi>Arrius, Photinus, Carpocrates, Seruetus, Sabellius, Praxeas,</hi> the <hi>Tritheits,</hi> and <hi>Gentilis,</hi> &amp; their ſcholers, are laid for dead, and therefore are meet for euer to be buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the graues of infamous, and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous heretiques. For <hi>Arrius,</hi> though he granted that Chriſt had a being before his incarnation, yet he could neuer be brought to confeſſe, that in that being, he was God, from euerlaſting, coeternal, and coeſſentiall with the father. <hi>Photinus</hi> and <hi>Seruetus,</hi> with their crue, held he was God, and the ſonne of God, and ſo might be called, but not by nature, but by grace, and office. <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> likewiſe acknowledged in Chriſt, beſides his manhoode a celeſtiall and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine nature, but yet he would not yeelde that it was of the ſame eſſence that his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers was. <hi>Sabellius</hi> &amp; <hi>Praxeas</hi> would haue there to bee but one perſon, named with three names, &amp; the <hi>Tritheits</hi> &amp; <hi>gentilis</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded for the deſtinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the 3. perſons,

For what can be plainer to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, then theſe words of <hi>Iohn? Cap.</hi> 1.1. and 2. <hi>In the beginning, was the worde, and the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:2586:45"/>word was with God, and the word was God:</hi> For the firſt clauſe ſhewes his exiſtence, and being from euerlaſting, the ſecond his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct exiſtence, and being in perſon, from his fathers, and that laſt his vnitie in eſſence with him. Plaine alſo to this ende is that which we read, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.2.3. For there the Apoſtle cals him the ſonne of God, whom his heauenlie father hath made heire of all things, and by whome he made the world, and he termeth him the brightnes of his glorie, and the ingraued forme of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, bearing vp all thinges by his mighty worde. For herein, his being before the world was, the diſtinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his of perſon from his fathers, and yet the vnitie of effence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, in moſt forceable words is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouched: let theſe therefore be ſufficiente for this pointe.</p>
            <p>Now if we would know what he became, and is by his incarnation, in perſon further, as I ſaid before, the reſt of the wordes of faint <hi>Paule</hi> before alleadged out of his 2. <hi>Chapter</hi> to the <hi>Philliplans,</hi> moſt notablie lay that alſo down before vs. For the Apoſtles purpoſe being to ſhew the <hi>Phillippians,</hi> how Chriſt humbled and abaſed himſelfe, for the good of his Church, that he doth in ſhewing them how firſt he did it, by taking
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:2586:45"/>vpon him the forme of a ſeruant, and by beeing made like vnto men, and by beeing found in ſhape of a man, ſo ſetting down the miſterie of his incarnation; and after by telling them howe beeing ſo become man, he humbled himſelfe to be obedient euen vnto the death for them, to purchaſe their redemption. Note therefore dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentlie (welbeloued) and marke reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſlie, the wordes of the Apoſtle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alleadged, to expreſſe the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of his incarnation. Firſt he faith, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, which we engliſh, but he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſed himſelfe, and made himſelfe of no reputation: which wordes teach vs, that though it be moſte true that we haue heard of him before, that voluntarily yet to ſhewe his obedience to the will of his father, and his loue towards his Church, when the time appointed of his father was come, he was content, though not to ceaſe to be that, which he had alwaies beene before which was impoſſible, yet ſo to haue the glorie and ſhining brightneſſe wherein alwaies thither vnto he had beene in with his father, for a time darkned, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured and hid, as that in compariſon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he might be ſaid and thought, euen much to haue abaſed himſelfe, <hi>yea to haue
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:2586:46"/>made himſelfe of no reputation.</hi> Nowe to ſhewe vs more particularly and ſpeciallie wherein this abaſing of himſelfe, laie, and how he did it, the Apoſtle ſayeth he did thus, euen himſelfe abaſe himſelfe, <hi>by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the forme of a ſeruant, &amp;c.</hi> thereby vnderſtanding, the verie nature of man, withall the properties and naturall infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties thereof, ſinne onely excepted, as we are taught to vnderſtand it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.17. <hi>&amp;</hi> 7.26. where the Apoſtle moſt plainelie teacheth that in all things, he in his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood was made like vnto his brethren, but that he was without ſinne. And theſe three wordes forme, ſhape, and ſimilitude, vſed by the Apoſtle heere himſelfe, make it euident, that he had a purpoſe as ſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally as might bee, to expreſſe as much. Yea the word ſeruant ſhews further that volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily alſo he became amongſt men, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer men from ſeruitude, euen the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ſeruant of men to ſerue vnder the burthen of their ſins, as one in whom there was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forme nor beauty, &amp; who was reiected and deſpiſed of men, as in that reſpect, the prophet <hi>Iſayah</hi> diſcribs him, 53.2.3.54. The Apoſtles meaning is therefore heereby to teach, that Chriſt being fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euerlaſting very God with his father, though a diſtinct per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:2586:46"/>from his father, that at he was not thus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſed againſt his wil, for that beeing ſo, he thoght it no robery to be equal to his father but that he himſelf moſt freely &amp; willingly was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent thus to ſtrip himſelf, or to empty himſelf, of that glory &amp; equality which he had naturally with his father, in taking vnto himſelfe, as he was &amp; is in the ſecond perſon in the trinity, the whole nature of man with all the ſinles, harmles, and naturall proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties therof, both in body &amp; ſoule, and in v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niting the ſame immediately in the creation thereof, yea in the very ſame inſtant and moment, with himſelfe, as he was the ſonne of God, perſonally, that ſo, as he was before in that he was the ſonne of God, almighty, infinite, incomprehenſible, and eternall, ſo he might bee, as he was the ſoune of man, weake, finite, comprehended, and mortall. The better yet once againe to make you ſee, that the Apoſtles meaning in theſe his wordes, ſtretch thus farre, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that which I haue noted already ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, obſerue and marke further, that he ſaith not the forme of God, eyther abaſed it ſelfe, tooke the forme of a ſeruant or was made in the likelihoode or ſimilitude of men, but he the which was in the forme, he made himſelf of no reputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; was made
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:2586:47"/>ſo, and found alſo in the ſhape of a man, to teach vs, if we will ſpeake like the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, and ſo accordingly beleeue, we muſt not ſay nor beleeue that nature tooke na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but the perſon of the ſonne tooke vnto himſelfe the nature of man, and ſo, that as he was created, ſo it was immediately vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto that perſon to haue togither, with that perſon, a perſonall vnion, and neuer to haue firſt any exiſtence or beeing a part, by, or in it ſelfe. For then the Apoſtle would haue ſaid aſwell that the thing aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, was he that was in the forme of a ſeruant, as he had ſaid that the aſſumer was he that was and had a beeing in the forme of God, which he doth not. The aſſumer thefore was the ſecond perſon in the trinity the ſonne of God, and neyther father, nor holie Ghoſt, nor yet the bare eſſence of God but as in it this ſecond perſon had his exiſtence and being; and the aſſumed, was not a perſon of a man firſt beeing and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſting a part, but the nature with all the aſſentiall and inſeparable harmeleſſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties thereof, of a true and verie man both in reſpect of his body and ſoule. That by this forme of a ſeruant, he ment not any other created nature, but the nature of man, he ſufficiently ſhe weth, by adding that he
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:2586:47"/>was made in the ſimilitude of man, and in ſhape found as a man. For <hi>Marcion</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heretiques heere upon gathering, that he aſſumed not the verie nature of man, but the ſhowe and phantaſme of a man, they doe moſt wilfullie but cauill, and foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhlie ſeek to darken a moſt manifeſt truth. For beſides that all the ſtory of his concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, birth, life, and death, and moſt plaine ſpeeches and phraſes continually vſed of him in the ſcriptures, prooue that he was a verie true and perfect man, both in bodie and ſoule, theſe wordes giue them no ground to build any ſuch concluſion vpon. For <hi>Adam</hi> is ſaid to haue begot <hi>Seth</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his owne image or likeneſſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5.3. and yet we might iuſtly counte them verie fond, that therefore woulde in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre, that <hi>Seth</hi> had not the verie nature of a man, that <hi>Adam</hi> had, but a bare ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow or ſimilitude thereof. The woordes <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> commonly engliſhed, taking and made, well vnderſtood, made it moſt cleare, that the ſecond perſon tooke vnto it ſelfe perſonally, the nature of man ſo that he vnited ſo verilie and perſonally with him ſelfe, as he was the ſonne of God, and the ſecond perſon in the trinitie, that nature of man that he aſſumed, that <hi>Iohn</hi> might
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:2586:48"/>iuſtlie ſay, <hi>the word was made fleſh, Cap.</hi> 1.14 and that we may moſt ſafely beleeue that he that before ſubſiſted onely in the forme of God, now alſo ſubſiſtes in the forme of a ſeruant, and that as in reſpect of the one nature he is the verie ſonne of God, equall to his father; ſo alſo in reſpect of the other, he is the verie ſonne of his mother, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie man, and ſo leſſer and inferiour to his father. In the olde teſtament, we reade he appeared in diuerſe formes vnto men, but yet we neuer can ſay that then he made him ſelfe of no reputation by taking ſuch forms vpon him, neyther therefore was he made the thinges he appeared to bee, becauſe he neuer aſſumed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo to himſelf, that he perſonally vnited himſelfe vnto them. And heereby alſo we may further learne, in that the aſſumer, and thing aſſumed, are thus both deſcribed heere, the one to be that, that had his beeing in the forme of God before, and in this worke remained ſtill himſelfe: and the other to be the forme of a ſeruant, accompanied or inueſted with the likeneſſe &amp; ſhape of a ſeruant: that both theſe, notwithſtanding this perſonall vnion, are entire and perfect in their owne nature, without any aboliſhing of eyther nature, or confounding of other in themſelues, or
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:2586:48"/>in the properties with the other in Chriſt. Laſtly theſe wordes are plaine and forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to make vs ſee, that notwithſtanding the aſſumer of the forme of a ſeruant vnto himſelfe, thereby is made in the likeneſſe of a man, and found in ſhape as a man, that yet he is but one perſon nowe ſubſiſting, both in the true forme of God, and in the verie nature or forme of man. For as of one perſon, after the finiſhing of this his incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, both heere and elſe where alwaies the goſpel ſpeaketh of him. Dreame there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may not, that this vnion of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man perſonally with the ſon of God is either in the commixtion of the two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or by the inhabitation of the one, in the other, or by the adioining of the one vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to the other, or by the aſſiſting of one the other, neither yet by the real co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication of the properties of the one with the other ſo, as that the one nature, may ſimply &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perly be ſaid, to be of the ſame properties, that the other is. For though water &amp; wine be mixed in one cup, the ſpirit of God dwel in the ſeruants of God, &amp; God adioyn him ſelf vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; aſſiſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> moſt apara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly euery where, yet ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not wine, the ſpirit, or God, be ſaid to haue ſo taken vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues water, the harts of men, or the ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of God, that
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:2586:49"/>therefore wine is made water, the ſpirit of God, or God, the heartes of men, or the ſeruants of God themſelues; as we heere ſee him that hath beene alwaies in the forme of God, ſaid to haue beene made in the forme of man, by his taking vnto himſelfe the forme of a ſeruant. And though moſt certaine it be, and therefore moſt vſuall in the ſcriptures alſo (the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to note the true, reall, eſſentiall, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall vnion, betwixt the ſonne of God, and the nature of man) to heare thoſe things that properly appertaine to the manhood to be affirmed of our bleſſed God and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, and alſo thoſe things that properlie belong vnto him onely as he is God, ſpoken of the man Chriſt: yet to make it euident, that as it is heretical, to confound the one nature with the other, that ſo it is alſo, and hath beene euer ſo accounted of all thoſe who by the motion of Gods ſpirit, and not of their owne, haue written the ſcriptures to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate properly the ſpecial proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the one vnto the other, they haue ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo ſpoken or writ, but ſpeaking of theſe two natures in the concrete, that is, as the wordes vſed to ſignifie the ſame not the perſon ſubſiſting in the eſſence and neuer ſpeaking thereof in the abſtract, as the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:2586:49"/>ſchoolemen ſpeake, that is, as the words v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, note the naked and ſimple eſſence in it ſelfe. And therefore for this true eſſentiall, and perſonall vnion of the ſonne of God, with the forme of a ſeruant, we ſay accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the trueth, and to the ſcriptures, that Chriſt is God and man, but we vſe not to ſay, he is Godhead and manheade, and we ſay, they crucified <hi>the Lorde of glorie,</hi> ſo noting that perſon that was and is the Lord of glorie, and vnderſtanding this of his perſon, not in reſpect of that nature whereby he was ſo the Lord of glory, but in reſpect of the other nature perſonally v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited thereunto, wherein he was paſſible and might be crucified. And ſo likewiſe ſpeaking of his perſon in reſpect of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nature, we may ſay, and ſay truely, the man Chriſt is almightie, euerie where and infinite, becauſe he is ſo in that reſpect, that he is the ſonne of God, but we may not ſay that his manhoode is ſo. For we muſt vnderſtand and alwaies remember, that whenſoeuer any thing is affirmed of Chriſt, in reſpect of the one nature that properly belonges vnto a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ther, that the meaning thereof neuer is to inueſt the one nature, with the properties that are pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to the other, but that ſo we ſpeake, to
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:2586:50"/>ſhewe the perſonall vnion of both in one perſon. Wee may ſee a prettie good i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage heereof in a man, as he conſiſtes of bodie and ſoule: for, becauſe of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring but of thoſe two natures together, to the conſtitution of a man as they doe, though infinitely it come ſhort of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching to the excellencie of this myſterie that we now ſpeake of, may truely be ſaid in diuerſe reſpectes, to be a heauenly cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature, and an earthly; mortall and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall: heauenly and immortall, in reſpect of his ſoule, and earthlie &amp; mortall, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his bodie: and diuerſe thinges that are proper to the bodie, are yet ſaide of the ſoule, and contrarie they which are ſpeciall to the ſoule, are affirmed of the bodie; as for example, we ſay ſomtimes the ſoule of man awaketh or ſleepeth, which are properly ſaide of the bodie, and we ſay the bodie heareth, ſeeth, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeth, when as in deede, the body can doe none of theſe, but by the ſoule: and yet as wee thinke they deſtroy the nature of man, that eyther for the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or coupling of theſe two together, to make a man, or for any of theſe phraſes, woulde eyther turne the one of theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the other, confounde one of theſe with
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:2586:50"/>the other, or inueſt the one nature reallie with the properties that be ſpeciall and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar vnto the other, ſo holde we it moſt firmely in this caſe, that it is, plainely he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall to doe the like. Theſe things ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thus weied and conſidered, we haue iuſt cauſe to ſay and thinke with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>That great is the myſterie of Godlines,</hi> namely euen this, <hi>that God is manifeſted in the fleſh, and yet iuſtifyed in the spirit, ſeene of Angels, preached vnto gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, beleeued on in the worlde, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued vp into glorie,</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. And by theſe thinges we may ſo clearely ſee our Chriſt in perſon to be verie God, and verie man, and yet for all that, but one perſon, as that both with the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> we may call him, <hi>The mightie and bleſſed God for euer.</hi> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.13. <hi>and the man Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> 1.2.5 and yet ſtill ſpeake of him, as but of the one perſon, as hee doth in both theſe places.

And whereas, if this opinion of his were true, it ſhould thereupon follow that then eyther the Godhead ſhoulde be turned into the manhoode, or the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode into the Godhead, for that of the commixtion of both, a third thing ſhould growe. Euerie one of theſe abſurd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequentes, <hi>Paule</hi> hath refelled alſo, by teaching vs both to remayne, without eyther turning of the one into the other, or confounding one of them, by anie
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:2586:52"/>commixtion or otherwiſe, one with an other, as we haue hearde.

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:2586:53"/>perſonally vnited in him, that he is one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and that without any conuerſion of the one nature into the other, or confuſion eyther of the natures themſelues, or of the ſeuerall and ſpeciall properties, the one with the other. For moſt neceſſarie it is that in euery reſpect he ſhoulde be ſuch an one, or elſe he neyther can be an able, nor fit perſon, to be our Ieſus. For though the ſinne of man, there being growne of Gods parte ſuch iuſt cauſe of enimitie againſt man, of mans, ſuch ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enation and auerſion of minde from God; as there is, it was firſt moſt meete, that he that ſhould be the attonement-maker twixt theſe, ſhoulde firſt in himſelfe haue the two natures at vnity and one. And then ſeeing the order of Gods iuſtice required, that as man had offended it, man againe ſhoulde appeaſe it, by vndergoing the burthen of the ſinnes of man, to ſatisfie fullie the ſame for them, as it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie, that he that woulde be mans ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, ſhoulde therefore be a verie man: ſo likewiſe becauſe no nature but that which is of power infinite, and therefore none but very God, coulde euer haue beene able to haue enabled the nature of man to vndertake, and effectuallie
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:2586:53"/>to go through with this moſt greate and hard worke, to ſatiſfie fully the infinite iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God for the ſinnes of the world, it was as needfull, that he ſhoulde be true and very God. Yea for theſe cauſes it was moſt requiſite that theſe two, verie God and the nature of man, ſhoulde be ſo vnited, as that thereof ſhoulde conſiſt but onely one perſon, as I haue ſaid, that ſo the paſſible nature might beare, as <hi>Eſay</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, <hi>the chaſtiſment of our peace. Eſay,</hi> 53.5. and that the other which is impaſſible, by the power and dignitie thereof, hauing it ſo perſonally, ſubſiſting in and with it ſelfe, might fit it for that purpoſe, not onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing vnto it power and ſtrength, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient therefore, but alſo, communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating vnto the thinges done and ſuffered to that end, by that nature, though in number, and for the time of the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing the ſame fruite, an infinite dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and worthyneſſe, to ſatiſfie the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite iuſtice of God, for the purchaſſing and compaſſing of mans ſaluation. For otherwiſe, if that nature, by this means had not been the manhode of one that was and is very God alſo, it might well haue entred into this worke, but doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe in wraſtling vnder the burthen of our
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:2586:54"/>ſinnes, againſt hell, death, and deuil, to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfie the infinite iuſtice and wrath of God for the ſame, it might well haue been ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed vp of death, and of the ſorrows of hel but it neither ſhoulde nor coulde euer haue valiently and triumphantly ouercome all theſe, and nailed as it were out ſins, and the hand writing that was againſt vs for the ſame, to his croſſe (as <hi>Paule</hi> ſpeaketh <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſ.</hi> 2.14.10. <hi>Begote vs againe vnto a liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie hope,</hi> that is, to aſſure vs, that he had gone through the worke, that he tooke in hand, as nowe through the power there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, by riſing againe, the third day from death to life, and by aſcending viſibly as a conqueror into heauen fourty daies after, and by ſitting euer ſince at the right hand of his father, in the heauenly places) moſt euidently he hath. <hi>For it is the ſpirite that, quickneth,</hi> and without that ſo vnited vnto it as it was, <hi>His fleſh could haue profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted nothing.

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:2586:54"/>that he ſaith, <hi>my fleſh, is meat indeed: and my bloode is drincke indeed: Ioh.</hi> 6.55. and againe 53.54. <hi>except yee eate the fleſh of the ſonne of man, and drincke his blood, yee haue no life in you: but whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer eateth my fleſhe, and drinketh my blood, hath eternall life, and I will raiſe him vp at the laſt day.</hi> For howe can it be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, but that he being as he is God and man in one perſon, by the meanes of this moſt high vnion of his Godhead with his manhoode, but that from the ſame Godhead, there muſt needes proceed and flowe throgh his manhoode, infinite power to quicken and ſaue all thoſe, that be partakers thereof? And how can it be poſſi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble, but that the heauenlie father, muſt needs account this his welbeloued ſonne, in whome he is well pleaſed, a fit and moſt ſufficient meanes to make him alſo to be well pleaſed, with all theſe, that confeſſe and acknowledge him to be in perſon as he is, and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently repoſe their redemption, and ſaluation. Whatſoeuer therefore others haue done, or yet doe, let vs learne by thus knowing and acknowledging Chriſt to be in perſon, to come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him.</p>

But firſt let vs heare what it ſaith touching the two former, and after we will come to the view alſo of the other. Touching the firſt of which, that is, full remiſſion of our ſinnes, as it was promiſed at the firſt by God to <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue. Gen:</hi> 3.15. <hi>That he ſhoulde tread downe the ſerpents heade:</hi> and after was more plainly reueiled to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel, that when Meſſiah the prince ſhoulde

And what can be more plaine and pregnant to this end then that ſweet ſaying of ſaint <hi>Paule this is a true ſaying &amp; worthie of al men to be receiued, that Ieſus Chriſt came into the world to ſaue ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> whereof in great humility and feeling of his ſins, he acknowledgeth himſelfe cheeſe. 1. <hi>Timo:</hi> 1.15. yea to ſhew vs that he tooke this remiſſion of ſinnes that he lookt for through Chriſt to be ful and perfect, not onely to diſcharge vs of all the eternall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhmentes due vnto vs, for our ſinnes in the worlde to come, but alſo, of the whole
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:2586:58"/>curſe of the law, within the compaſſe wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are all kinde of temporary puniſhments in this life, as we may ſee, <hi>Deu:</hi> 27. &amp; 28, as he ſaith, <hi>ther is no condemnation to thoſe that are in Chriſt Ieſus. Rom.</hi> 1.8. ſo <hi>Galathians</hi> the third the 13. alſo he writeth that he <hi>became accurſed for vs, to deliuer vs from the curſe of the law.</hi> And if the forgiuenes of our ſinnes that we looke for at Gods hand ſtretch not thus far, how could they be ſaid to be made, <hi>as white as ſnowe or woole, Iſay:</hi> 1.18. when they are forgiuen: or how could it be ſaid of God when he forgiues the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that he would remember them no more, as it is 31.34. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.17. <hi>Yea that then he caſtes them al into the bottom of the ſea, as he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth he wil, Math:</hi> 7.19? And yet as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie, comfortable, and certaine as you ſee this doctrine to be, the papiſts can not find in their harts, to let vs goe away with it thus wholie and freely. For firſt they direct<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly hold that ſins falne into after baptiſme, haue a number of fountaines of water to waſh them in, and meanes to purge the owners thereof, beſides Chriſt Ieſus and his merits. Their ſacrament of pennance which they holde to conſiſte of contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, confeſſion and ſatiſfaction: and the prieſtes abſolution thereupon, in this caſe
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:2586:59"/>muſt ſerue vs as a ſecond planke after ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke to fly vnto, and to eſcape the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the tempeſtuous ſeas of Gods wrath by: and if this will not ſerue, then <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> ſatiſfactorie workes done by mans owne ſelfe and others extraine vnction, and laſtly the enduring of the paines of purgatory, and the mediation of Saints and Angels, all laid together, ſhal help them quite to be diſcharged from thoſe ſinnes, and the puniſhments yet by them to be ſuffered for them, from which they durſt not for all this euidence that I haue brought, looke fully to be deliuered by the precious blood of Chriſt Ieſus. And yet they cannot be ignorant, that as in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the ſacrament of his body and blood, he calde the cup the newe teſtament in his blood, which ſhoulde be ſhed for the remiſſion of ſinnes. <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.28. that ſo when it was ſhed to that end, and therefore he euen readie to die: that to ſhewe that by that death of his all meritorious ſuffering &amp; ſatiſfying for ſinne had an end, he ſaid <hi>conſummatum eſt,</hi> that is, it is finiſhed, <hi>Io:</hi> 19.30. And that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrwes,</hi> the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute ſufficiencie of the ſacrifice offered by Chriſt to purchaſſe vs full and perfect
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:2586:59"/>redemption and ſaluation by the remi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſion of our ſinnes, once for all by his owne perſon, is ſo aduouched as though, the holie Ghoſt therein of purpoſe direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the writer to preuent and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute all theſe deuiſes, who may not ſee? The ſtone that they woulde ſeeme eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to ſtumble at, and whereby to fall into theſe conceites, is that which we reade 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. that notwithſtanding vpon <hi>Danids</hi> repentance he tolde him, that God had forgiuen him his ſinne and put it away, <hi>verſe:</hi> 13. yet he not onelie denounceth a iudgment againſt him vpon occaſion of that his ſinne, but alſo it after followeth and is ſhewed, howe it was in deed executed vpon him. For here vpon, when other ſhiftes faile them, to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance their antichriſtian ecclipſing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facing the full and ſtee remiſſion of ſinnes, ye of all our ſinnes, originall and actuall, before baptiſme and after, that any way are remiſſible, they imagine yet they may hold thisfaſt, that howſoeuer by and in him, we may haue remiſſion of the ſins them ſelues, and releaſe of the eternall puniſhmentes due therefore, that yet there may and doeth remaine ſome temporary to be abid or ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for, by our ſelues, or other of our good
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:2586:60"/>friendes, either here in this life, or in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory in the life to come. But alas who ſeeth not, that the ground which they haue from hence is to weake and ſandy, to build ſuch a huge heape of ſatiſfactory workes and ſufferings vpon, as here v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon to rob Chriſt, and to aduatire and enrich them ſelues, they woulde faine builde? For though this and the like dealing of GOD with his ſeruantes, proue that God may and doth for iuſt cauſes known vnto himſelfe, take occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by their ſinnes, to chaſtiſe them and to correct them for the ſame though he haue before forgiuen them their ſinnes, and neuer meane that they ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be condemned, yet neither this, nor all the like examples euer can proue, that by the enduring of, or ſatiſfying for theſe any way or by any bodie, Gods mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning euer was, that they ſhoulde per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the worke of the remiſſion of their ſinnes. For doubtleſſe his ſonne hauing vndertaken the purchaſing of this for vs at his handes, and there lacking in him neither ſkill nor power nor affection, to go through with the worke which he had taken in hand, without doing of him to manifeſt and open wrong, in robbing of
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:2586:60"/>him, in taking from him that which is his due, we muſt fully be perſuaded that for our ſinnes he hath ſo fully ſatiſfied his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly father, that he will thinke we doe him greate iniurie, and much ſtaine his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, if by any other doing or ſuffering we ſhoulde offer him any other price or pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againe therefore. Such puniſhments therefore either threatned by God or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted vpon his children after in Chriſt their ſinnes are forgiuen them, they are his fatherly chaſtiſments, to teach them the better to ſee the vileneſſe and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſneſſe of ſinne, and ſerue both them and other as Gods ſanctified meanes to warne them to take more heed of ſinne thereafter, and to mortifie them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto: but in no ſort muſt wee be ſo foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh as with theſe kinde of men to imagine, that they muſt either be endured, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe bought out by our owne ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions or of others, to make perfect or to conſummate the full remiſſion of our ſinnes. By theſe deuiſes they ſet their prieſts and prelats a loft in the conſciences of men, as though they could abſolue them, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge them from that, from which all the blood ſhed of Chriſt Ieſus though neuer ſo well beleeued in, hath not yet quitte
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:2586:61"/>them, and ſo by their deuiſe of purgatorie, and their manner of releeuing of ſoules there by their pardons, maſſes and dirges &amp;c: and by doing of theſe, and by their abſolution, extraine vnction, and their taking vpon them to offer Chriſt againe to his father for them, as though his owne offering of him ſelfe coulde not ſerue the turne, they haue wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully enriched themſelues. What other reaſons ſoeuer they may pretend hereof, if theſe were not the reaſons indeede that ſet them and helde them in this way, they had long agoe, or would quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be glad with vs, to preach and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, ful remiſſion of all ſinnes, both in reſpect of the guiltineſſe and puniſhment alſo, by and thorow the onely ſufferings and ſatiſfaction done by Chriſt. For what reaſon in the worlde can cauſe them but once to thinke that Chriſt hath borne the burthen of our ſins, but ſo in his owne bodie vpon the tree, that he ſhould, when he had done, returne the ſame againe vpon vs in ſome forte to beare and to ſuffer for? Or if they woulde needes holde this to be thus, howe can they tell howe much Chriſt hath ſuffered and howe much he hath left to be ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:2586:61"/>by vs, or when they haue ſuffered all that eyther for quantitie or quality, is meete to make the remiſſion plenarie, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plet and full. But thus in the iuſt iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God it is fit, that they ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle themſelues with groſſe and intricate abſurdities, that leaue the onely true way to heauen, Chriſt Ieſus, and thus ſeeke out biepathes of their owne inuention to bring them thither. Let vs therefore (good brethren) giue no care vnto them, but as we haue beene moſt plainely taught out of the canonicall ſcriptures, be fullie perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that there is full and abſolute remiſſion of all our ſinnes vnto vs if we repent ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of aright and beleeue in Chriſt Ieſus.</p>
            <p>And as plainely doubtleſſe doe the ſame ſcriptures,

And yet I am not ignorant, that the papiſtes are at ſuch oppoſition alſo to this, that their learned diuines of <hi>Louan</hi> moſt impudently and ſhamefully haue written, that it is as abſurde to ſay that we can be made righteous by the imputation of Chriſtes righteouſnes, as it is for a man to

And leſt with the papiſtes we ſhoulde thinke, that this righteouſneſſe, is that inchoated inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent righteouſneſſe, which is founde in the regenerate, taught them by the law, and wrought in them by the ſpirit of God, receiued by beleeuing the Goſpell, which indeede the ſcriptures call ſanctification, and the fruites of the ſpiritte in ſuch, he ſaith in the firſt to the <hi>Romanes.</hi> 17. <hi>That this righteouſneſſe of God, is reuealed by the Goſpell, from faith to faith:</hi> and that as he addeth, <hi>without the lawe.

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:2586:62"/>by the lawe, and whereof more and more according to the increaſinges of our faith, we find our ſelues poſſeſſed. For this righteouſneſſe of God, is by the faith of Ieſus Chriſt, vnto all and vpon all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, as he ſpeaketh in the verie next verſe: but this we cannot ſay of the foreſaid inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent righteouſneſſe in any of our ſelues: for the lawe rightlie vnderſtoode, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueales vnto vs a perfect rule of holines and righteouſneſſe, yea perfecter, then through the weakeneſſe of the fleſhe, it is poſſible for vs to anſwere and keepe, as long as we liue heere. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. and therefore, becauſe without ſuch a righteouſneſſe as is perfect in the eies of GOD himſelfe, we can haue no entrance into the moſt righteous king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, he hath, as there we are taught, ſent his ſonne in the ſimilitude of ſinfull fleſh, to condemne ſinne in the fleſh, <hi>That wee that walke not after the fleſh, but after the ſpiritte, in him, yet might haue the righteouſneſſe of the lawe fulfilled in vs.</hi> 3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4. <hi>verſ.</hi> For Chriſt is the ende of the lawe for righteouſneſſe to euery one that beleeueth. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.4.

Now as for their ſecond ſhift, the vanity &amp; falſhoode therof, will ſoone appeare to any that with any indifferencie wil but conſider <hi>Paules</hi> wordes, when in handling of this point he ſhutteth out workes of the lawe from hauing any thing to doe in the office of iuſtifying. For writing as he did alwaies when he handled this queſtion, not to Iewes, that indeede thorowe ignorance both of Chriſt and of the true meaning and vſe of the lawe, vſed to ſeeke by the workes of the lawe, in their ſence, that is, by workes taught by the lawe and done before grace, to be iuſtified, but to conuerted and beleeuing Gentiles: to what purpoſe had it beene to labour ſo often and ſo earneſtlie to driue them from ſeeking iuſtification by ſuch workes of the lawe, whereof they coulde neuer make anie ſuch reckoning, in that before their conuerſion, they were not ſo much as once acquainted with the lawe. If ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt thinke, (as we are bounde) that <hi>Paule</hi> wrote and ſpoke to the purpoſe, and aptlie to thoſe that he had to deale withall, out of all queſtion we muſt needs
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:2586:66"/>be of that iudgement, that he taught euen the conuerted and beleeuing gentiles, in what meaſure ſoeuer the ſpirit of grace en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled them to haue, and to performe, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo manie good workes of the lawe, yet when they were neuer ſo full of them to truſt perfectly, freely to be iuſtified by the grace of God, through the redemption that is in Chriſt Ieſus, and not at all by the workes of the lawe. Alas who is ſo ſimple as to thinke, that the falſe Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles ſought to perſwade the <hi>Galathians,</hi> whome <hi>Paule</hi> had left ſetled in ſeeking their iuſtification freely by faith in Chriſt, to ſeeke manie ſo to be iuſtified in part, or in whole, by workes of the lawe done without or before grace? and yet if this popiſh gloſe muſt ſtand, <hi>Paule</hi> in his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle written of purpoſe to perſwade the <hi>Galathians,</hi> not to liſten to theſe, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to ſeeke any way to be iuſtified before God by the workes of the lawe, therein eyther diſputes to no purpoſe, and fightes but with his owne ſhadowe, or elſe it muſt be granted that theſe were the workes of the lawe, that they were taught by them to put ſome truſt and confidence in, which to imagine were moſt groſſe and abſurde, for there is no likelihoode
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:2586:67"/>therein at all. His reaſons that he vſed to ſhut out the workes of the lawe, from the office of iuſtifying, are theſe, for by the lawe, <hi>commeth the knowledge of ſinne. Rom.</hi> 3.20. <hi>For that our reioycing is in this caſe excluded not by the lawe of works, but by the lawe of faith, verſ.</hi> 27. <hi>For that if</hi> Abraham <hi>were iuſtified by workes he hath wherein to reioyce, but not with God, for that the wages is counted to him that worketh, not of fauour (as he taketh it for graunted it was to</hi> Abraham <hi>and muſt be to all the children of</hi> Abraham, <hi>in this caſe</hi>) <hi>but of debt,</hi> which likewiſe he aſſumeth as graunted to be in this point abſurde. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.2.4. <hi>For if they which are of the lawe be heires, faith is made voyde and the promiſe is of none effect. For the lawe cauſeth wrath.</hi> 14.15. <hi>therefore it is by faith, that it might come by grace, and the promiſe might be ſure to all the ſeeds.</hi> 16. <hi>As mante as are of the workes of the lawe are vnder the curſe. For it is written, curſed is euery one that continueth not in all thinges which are written in the booke of the lawe to doe them:</hi> No man is iuſtified by the lawe in the ſight of God it is euident, <hi>for the iuſt ſhall liue by faith: and to</hi> Abraham <hi>and his ſeede were the promiſes made: he ſaith not, and to thy ſeedes, as ſpeaking of
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:2586:67"/>manie but and to thy ſeede, as of one which is Chriſt. Gal.</hi> 3.10.11.16. Euerie and all of which argumentes, make and ſerue ſtrongly, not onely to debarre woorks done before grace, according to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward letter of the lawe, from all office and power to iuſtifie, but alſo all workes done after grace, effectually if mans owne free will in ſuch ſort concurre to the working of them as they teach. For euen therein and when they are done, the lawe findeth ſuch imperfection in the doer, as we may ſee by <hi>Paules</hi> owne confeſſion. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24. that he hath cauſe to crie: <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliuer mee from this bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of ſinne and death,</hi> and to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge euen in ſuch a one as then he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe was (who doubtleſſe was then in the ſtate of grace, that the lawe is ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealer of ſin yet to be in him, and therfore alſo of wrath, that he is ſo farre off from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing any cauſe by his own works done after grace, to thinke that he deſerueth to be iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified or ſaued in any reſpect, that thereby he may iuſtly with him take occaſion to confeſſe, that though <hi>the law be ſpiritual yet he is carnal, &amp; ſo ſold vnder ſinne, that in his fleſh there dwelleth no good thing, for though to will is preſent with him, &amp; that he allowe not
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:2586:68"/>the euill he doth, becauſe in his inner man he conſenteth vnto the lawe that it is holie and good, yet he doth ſometimes the euill that he hateth and findeth no meanes, as he ſhoulde, to performe that which is good, Verſ.</hi> 14. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And by workes done after grace, flowing (as they ſay) from our owne freewill in great part, if iuſtification ſhould come at all, how then could we be excluded from all reioyeing in that reſpect in our ſelues? how coulde our iuſtification come freely and of ſauour, and not at all of debt, as <hi>Paule</hi> teacheth it muſt? how could it be but in ſome ſorte we ſhoulde be heires by the lawe, and not onely by faith and the vertue of the promiſe, neyther of which can be ſure and certaine, if they reſted vpon the condition of the workes that we at any time can doe, which we can neuer be ſure that we haue attained vnto, eyther in that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or manner (as they themſelues are dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to confeſſe) as is required of vs. Yea if thereby at all, our iuſtification coulde come, why then was not the promiſe made vnto vs in the plurall number, in ſeedes, and not in ſeede, to warrant vs, as eſpecially to looke for the benefitte thereof by the merites of the ſeede of the woman, of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and

               <hi>Iacob,</hi> ſo partly and ſecondarily at leaſt, by our ſelues, and our owne merits or workes ioyned with his? But to ende this point, what can be more cleare to put vs out of all doubt, that <hi>Paule</hi> ſhuts not from this office of iuſtifying, onely workes of the lawe done before grace, but alſo the beſt workes done in grace, then that he himſelfe in the third of the <hi>Philippians</hi> (as we heard before) in this reſpect, doth not onely in the time paſt diſable his own good workes done according to the lawe before his conuerſion vnreproueable, but alſo in the verie preſent time when he wrote that Epiſtle, which was not long before his death, his workes or righteouſneſſ which he then had, as dung, that ſo he might be iuſtified by another righteouſneſſe, to be founde and attained vnto, by faith in Chriſt. In that alſo, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. Firſt he confeſſeth, <hi>that he knew nothing by himſelfe,</hi> (ſpeaking then of himſelfe as he was in the ſtate of grace) and then by and by he addeth, <hi>that he was not thereby iuſtified,</hi> he plainely ſhewed that though he had liued ſo in the execution of his Apoſtleſhip, that his conſcience accuſed him not of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion therein any way (within the compaſſe whereof laye moſte of the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:2586:69"/>workes that he had done in grace) yet he thought not thereby to be iuſtified at all. Wherefore from whom ſoeuer theſe our aduerſaries haue ſucked or learned this gloſe or interpretation of <hi>Paules</hi> wordes, euidentlie heereby it appeareth, that it is a curſed gloſe, for that it ſo directly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupteth the text, and therefore vpon whom ſoeuer they would father it, to put the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie and ſhame thereof from themſelues, both of them muſt giue vs leaue, rather to forſake them heerein, then the plaine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence of the ſcriptures themſelues, which I am fullie perſwaded though they hardlie or neuer will be brought vnto, they ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

For ſo we finde they were willing to doe, when eyther by their owne further rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or learning, or by the information of others, they had cauſe giuen them to ſee, wherein for lacke of further aduiſe,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:2586:69"/>they haue erred: and neuer did any of theſe by farre thus interpret <hi>Paules</hi> wordes to aduance mans merits, and to darken and obſcure the glorie of Chriſt, as they doe, yea if they coulde haue but foreſeene that euer after any woulde haue come af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them, thus to abuſe their wordes, to driue men from ſeeking at all to be iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the imputation of Chriſtes righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe to the beleeuer in him, that then they might truſt to their owne righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe inherent in themſelues, inhabit, as to the formall cauſe of their iuſtification, and in worke wrought, as to the merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious cauſe of another iuſtification, euen of ſaluation it ſelfe: I dare be bolde to ſay they woulde neuer by any meanes haue beene drawen, to haue left one ſillable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde them in their writinges ſounding that way. And this ſufficientlie may appeare to any that hath but red their workes, therein they are elſewhere ſo plaine, full and pregnant, to aduouch iuſtification freely by faith in Chriſt, through the imputation of his merits and righteouſneſſe vnto men, as in ſundrie places of an anſwere of mine in printe to <hi>Iohn de Albïne,</hi> I haue at large ſhewed, whereunto I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore nowe referre the Chriſtian Reader.
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:2586:70"/>And whereas by grace, whereby <hi>Pauls</hi> faith we are iuſtified, they woulde beare men in hand, that there by grace is not to be vnderſtood the free ſauour of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes man in Chriſt Ieſus, but that ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall gift of that grace, the habit of chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie infuſed or powred into them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, all the reaſons and places vſed to confute the former ſhift of theirs, ſerue alſo as pregnantly to ouerthrow this.

For this were not onely to leaue the worke of mans iuſtification and ſaluation to be vnperfect, for all that hath beene done by him in his owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but alſo moſt vncertaine, whether euer it ſhoulde be finiſhed or no, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if the matter be thus to be deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

Yea if this were thus, that amongſt otherendes that Chriſt had in his merits and ſufferinges, he had this, thereby ſo to die our doings and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings therewith, that they nowe ſhall be meritorious of, and ſatisfactorie for our owne ſaluation, (though by thus ſaying they would ſeeme to attribute vnto Chriſts merits more then we doe, in that we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie them this effect) in deede and trueth in thus dealing, they with <hi>Iudas</hi> giue him faire wordes, ſaying vnto him, haile mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, when in ſecret cunninglie, they moſt vnkindlie and wickedlie ſeeke to betraye him. Heeretofore when they taught this doctrine of mans merits, bluntly, and flatly without this new colour of their ſo doing, we iuſtly charged themſelues to be the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegious robbers of Chriſt, of that chiefe and ſpeciall honour that appertaines vnto him: but now whiles they haue ſought, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyd &amp; to put fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> themſelues the grieuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of this charge, by this their new deuiſe, in ſteed of making Chriſt ſome reſtitution and
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:2586:72"/>amendes for the wrong they did him, they nowe are flatly come to this, obſtinately to continue in the doing of him the ſame old wrong ſtill, but nowe they will no longer be the onely doers thereof them ſelues, but he himſelfe muſt bee, if not the plaine and full principall, yet at the leaſt an open and notorious acceſſary, and helper forward of them, in this their rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing of him. But whatſoeuer they ſay or doe herein, let vs with the apoſtle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, that he is able perfectly to ſaue them that come vnto God by him, <hi>ſeeing he euer liueth to make interceſſion for them, and hath an euerlaſting prieſthoode. Heb.</hi> 7.24.25. For as we haue often heard before, an other of them writeth, his owne ſelfe bare our finnes in his body vpon the tree, and ſo, that thereby we are both deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from ſinne, and ſo healed thereof, that thenceforth we ſhoulde liue in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. 1. <hi>Pet:</hi> 1.2.4. And with all our heartes let vs ſhunne and deteſt all theſe their popiſh demſes, tending as we ſee all more or leſſe, to the robbing of Chriſt of this ſpeciall honour, to be a full and a perfect ſauiour in,
<note place="margin">That he is King Frieſt &amp; Prophet</note> of, and by him ſelfe.</p>
            <p>To proceed therefore, as thus in theſe two pointes particularly, you haue heard,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:2586:72"/>howe the goſpell ſheweth you this to be his office, ſo for the reſt before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, if we looke into it, it will teach vs, that in this his office, he is our Chriſt, that is, our annointed and appointed kinge, prieſt, and prophet, in and for his Church King to rule, gouerne, and to protect it, from all the enimies and dangers there of: prieſt, to redeeme it, and to make full and perfect atonement and reconſiliation tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe his eternall interceſſion, betwixt God and it: and prophet to teach and inſtruct it, by his worde from time to time. So that he hath of his Church <hi>a prieſtly kingdome, which he hath purchaſed, not with gold or ſiluer, but with his owne pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus blood, as Peter</hi> ſpeaketh. 1. <hi>epiſt:</hi> 1.19. <hi>which he gouerneth and ordereth by the ſcepter of his worde, and perfecteth by the powre of his ſpirit.</hi> Of the title and right of his kingrick, <hi>Paule Heb.</hi> 4.8. vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth that, <hi>Pſal:</hi> 45.6. and 7. as ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of Dauid, thorow the ſpirit: <hi>thy throne is for euer and euer, the ſcepter of thy king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is a ſcepter of righteouſneſſe, thou haſt loued righteouſneſſe and hated iniquitie, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cuen God thy God, hath annointed thee with the oyle of gladnes, aboue thy fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes.</hi> And touching his prieſthoode to

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:2586:73"/>and yet he is ſuch a king, as that he is king of kings, and Lord of Lords, <hi>Reue.</hi> 19.16. And as king he is lawgiuer vnto his people in whoſe power it is to ſaue and deſtroy. <hi>Iam.</hi> 4.12. As king he gouerneth and gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his Church, both heere and in heauen, as the head thereof, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 1.22.

And as king he defendeth and protecteth it from all the enemies thereof, <hi>Luke.</hi> 1.17 78. <hi>And of this kingdome of his there is no end, Luke.</hi> 1.33. Now as he is prieſt, <hi>he hath offered once for all, ſuch a ſacrifice for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of his Church, that he needeth not any other prieſt to ſucceed him, either to offer any other, or that againe: &amp; thus hauing ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained for vs eternall redemption, and aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding into the heauens, there he ſits at the right hand of the father, and appearing continually in his ſight, he maketh ſuch continual interceſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for vs, that he is able perfectly to ſane thoſe that come vnto God by him. Heb.</hi> 7.23.25. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10. <hi>verſ.</hi> 12. <hi>&amp;</hi> 9.24. Finally as prophet and teacher of his Church: <hi>Whatſoeuer be hath heard of his father, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming from his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, he hath declared vnto vs, Ioh.</hi> 1, 18.8.26. And this hath he done moſt ſufficiently (as
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:2586:74"/>we haue often in our writings alreadie in print moſt plentifully proued, in directing by his ſpirit, as he hath done, the writers of the canonicall ſcriptures, therein to ſet downe al neceſſarie doctrine for our ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And therefore beſides, or contrarie to that, nothing is to be vrged vpon his Church, or to be receiued thereby, as neceſſarie to ſaluation. All theſe thinges now rightlie vnderſtoode, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confeſſed and acknowledged to be true of Chriſt, and thus to appertaine vnto him, then and not before is he come vnto, as heere in my text is required and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. This doctrine of the perſon and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Chriſt, is the verie rocke and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation whereupon the Church of Chriſt is built, and whereupon it beeing built, the gates of hell <hi>ſhall neuer preuaile againſt it, Math.</hi> 16.18. <hi>An other foundation can no man lay, but euen this, Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.11. Yea this Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>is the foundation of the Apoſtles and prophets</hi> (namely which they laide) <hi>and the chiefe corner ſtone, in whome al the building coupled togither, grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vnto an holie temple in the Lord,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh to the <hi>Epheſians, Cap.</hi> 2.20.21. Heereby then it is euident, that not onely Turkes, and Iewes, and all ſuch as are
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:2586:74"/>open enimies to Chriſt, &amp; to this doctrine of him, but alſo all thoſe that would ſeeme to receiue him, &amp; yet wil not thus in tertain him in their heartes and iudgementes, as yet ſtand aloofe from him, and dare not ſo much as come vnto him. Amongſt which latter ſort we muſt needes muſter our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticall and next aduerſaries the papiſtes. For not onely as I haue alreadie ſhewed, for the maintenance of their owne deuiſes, haue they bene iuſtly found guilty, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned, of croſſing the doctrin both of Chriſts perſon and office, both general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and particularly in all the former bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches thereof, but alſo in the three laſt ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, may they likewiſe be charged and adiudged, and that moſt iuſtly. For there is neyther his kingricke, prieſthood, nor prophetſhip, that they can finde in their hearts to leaue whole and entire vnto him. For to the lawes and orders appointed by him as king, for the good gouernment of his Church, they adde, detract and alter at their pleaſures, ſo that a man might eaſily make a huge and large booke of nothing elſe but a bare recitall of their additions thereunto, takinges therefrom, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations thereof, as any man by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the recordes of the ſcriptures, wherein
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:2586:75"/>his are ſet downe, with their doctrine and practiſe, may eaſily and ſoone perceiue. And what can they worſe abide, then to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Chriſt to be ſuch a prieſt of the newe Teſtament, as the goſpell hath before deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed heere to bee. For then their ſhauen prieſthood &amp; the offering of Chriſt againe to his father, as a propitiatorie ſacrifice for the ſins of quicke and dead, and for what purpoſe ſoeuer they for their gaine liſt to intend it, and their inuocation &amp; mediation of Saints and Angels, ſhoulde all lie in the duſt, whereby they chiefly maintaine both their credit and wealth. And their writing many treatiſes and large bookes to argue the canonicall ſcriptures of obſcuritie (to diſcourage the ſimple from reading of them or caring to haue them red) and of inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencie (to eſtabliſh their vnwritten word of their owne traditions, as the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted word of God,) to what ende elſe tendes it, then moſt openly to thruſt Chriſt from his office of beeing the doctor &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet of his Church, by opening his mouth ſo plentifully therein, as he hath, for the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient direction thereof: that they taking that office vpon them, vnder the title of the Churches practiſe and tradition, may war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant all their fooleries and errours, for the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:2586:75"/>which the beſt of them ſometimes haue confeſſed, their chiefe ground comes from thence. You may therefore moſt plainly ſee that howſoeuer in words they would ſeeme to giue him his due titles of God, and man, Chriſt, Meſſiah, Ieſus, Sauiour of the world, King, Prieſt, and Prophet, by their deedes in their ordinarie doctrine and practiſe, they pull from him the force and power of the ſame againe. For ſuch a God and man he muſt be to ſerue their turne, as vnder their hoſte can and will lie hidde ſo quietlie, that euery receiuer may eate him with his mouth, how ſinfull and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſoeuer he be: and ſuch an one in his office for all his titles they giue him, he muſt be content to bee, as will ſuffer all the things &amp; perſons which they haue ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined will ſerue to that purpoſe, to ioyne with him in that high &amp; glorious worke of meriting and deſeruing, procuring and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting the worke of our ſaluation: let him tell them neuer ſo plainely, <hi>that his name is the Lord, and that he is as his name is, and that therefore he will not giue his honour, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to any other perſon or thing. Iſa.</hi> 42.8. Doubtleſſe if any of the thinges they talk of in this caſe, might ioyne with him &amp; his merits, in this great and high worke of
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:2586:76"/>meriting or deſeruing for man the kingdom of heauen, good and holie workes done in grace and faith, are moſt likely to be they that might partake with him therein. But ſo farre off euen their great champion <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> found it to be, doe what he could, to intitle theſe heereunto, that when he had ſtriuen with all the cunning and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er he had to the end, and ſo woulde faine ſhewe howe man to that purpoſe might thereupon ground his truſt &amp; confidence, he is driuen to confeſſe, when all comes to all, that the confidence that man can haue, eyther by meanes of them or any way elſe of his ſaluation, is but humane, morall and coniecturall, and no way ſuch as certainty of faith requireth, but as may and will haue with it, ſtill feare, leaſt it deceiue them in the end. Yea after he hath a little wreſtled with our obiection againſt iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and comming to ſaluation by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent righteouſneſſe of our owne, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer before he ſeemed to himſelfe to run away with it, as a matter moſt cleare, that that might be truſted to, to worke and to procure theſe effectes: he is ſo cooled, that he concludes the matter but thus, that he allowes confidence to be put in good works indeed, ſo that pride therein be auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded:
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:2586:76"/>but yet for that, that pride is ſo hardly auoided in this caſe as it is, &amp; we are alwaies ſo vncertaine as we muſt needes bee, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we haue attained to that meaſure and manner of righteouſneſſe, that to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is neceſſary, he thinketh it moſt ſafe, when we haue done all the good works we haue or can, that yet we put all our truſt and confidence, in the onely mercy and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God. Which what is it elſe, but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hath done his worſt, againſt the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſts righteouſneſſe, to make the beleeuer in him righteous by, for the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing of this their own inherent righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes in the romphe therof, euen then to caſt vs the bucklets, and for ſhame to take his heeles, and to run away from his cauſe, and to leaue vs both the field &amp; the victory. But alwaies great is the trueth, and it will preuaile. Wherfore howſoeuer they thinke of themſelues, we may plainely inough ſee, that their caſe is pitifull and lamentable, in their ſtriuing thus, to darke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; to obſcure the glorie of Chriſt, for the maintenance and ſetting vp of themſelues and their owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſes in his romphe, and yet when all comes to all, to be enforced thus in effect to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that all the while they haue but kic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked againſt the prickts, and for that, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:2586:77"/>they dare not truſt in concluſion. God of his mercy make them to ſee their groſſe errours heerein, and in the meane time let vs runne by the light of the goſpell, this way be Chriſt, by acknowledging him, both in perſon and office to be ſuch an one as I haue thereby proued and manifeſted him to bee: which when we haue done, then we haue made a good beginning to obey Chriſtes commaundement heere, but yet the chefe is behinde, for he further ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, and drinke.</p>
            <p>By this drinking,
<note place="margin">Chriſte muſt be caten and drunken and there fore there muſt be had a true co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion with him.</note> he doubtleſſe vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode drinking of himſelfe, thereby im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying eating of himſelfe alſo: for as he ſaid in the former chapter, <hi>Except yee drinke his blood,</hi> ſo withall he ſaith, <hi>except ye eate the fleſh of the ſonne of man, yee haue no life in you, and whoſoeuer eateth my fleſh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternall life, and I wil raiſe him vp at the laſt day, verſ.</hi> 53. <hi>&amp;</hi> 54. By which figuratiue &amp; metaphorical kinde of ſpeach, he would teach vs, that as it is not inough for him that is hungry and thirſty to come where meate and drinke is, to ſee and behold them, yea perfectly to knowe them, and be able to ſay what euery thing is, and to what vſe it ſerueth, but if he would haue his hunger and thirſt ſatisfied, he muſt
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:2586:77"/>thereof both eate and drinke: euen ſo is it in this caſe. For it is not inough to come vnto Chriſt, though we come from point to point as I haue ſhewed, vnleſſe that done, we goe further, yea ſo farre as that we as ſurely and verily take him vnto vs, and into vs, and ſo make him as certainely our own, as meate &amp; drinke receiued in and wel di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, may be ſaid to be our owne. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it moſt clearely appeareth, that as no benefite can ariſe to the maintenance of this preſent life by meat and drinke, vnleſſe they be eaten vpon &amp; drunken, and as ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſap, and iuice that is in the meate, nor the power nor force of the drinke can be made ours to nouriſh &amp; ſtrengthen our bodies, vnleſſe we eate &amp; drinke the meat and drinke themſelues, wherein they are lodged &amp; contained: euen ſo is it betwixt Chriſt &amp; vs. And therefore, <hi>Though he be the bread of life, &amp; his fleſh meat indeed, &amp; his blood drink indeed,</hi> as we are plainly taught by him they are in the former chap. <hi>ver.</hi> 53 55. yet we can be neuer the nearer therby, to the maintena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of our ſpiritual life before God, vnles by an eating &amp; drinking of him, fit for that purpoſe, we feed vpon him, &amp; cat &amp; drink himſelf, &amp; ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly by making him wholly God &amp; man our very own, and
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:2586:78"/>ſo growing into vnion &amp; communion with him, we attaine vnto all thoſe good things, that are prepared for vs in him. And to put vs out of al doubt hereof, Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> in his firſt Epiſtle, <hi>Cap.</hi> 1.3. ſheweth vs that the whole ſcope of his miniſtrie and of his fellow A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles was, that there by this communion and fellowſhip with Chriſt might be attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, ſaying, <hi>That which wee haue ſeene and heard, declare wee vnto you, that ye may alſo haue fellowſhip with vs, and that our fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip may be with the father, and with his ſonne Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Againe moſt plaine it is to this purpoſe, that he writeth, <hi>Cap.</hi> 5. of that Epiſtle, <hi>verſ.</hi> 11.12. where he ſaith <hi>That God hath giuen vs eternall life, he that hath the ſonne, hath life, and he that hath not the ſonne, hath not life.</hi> For heerby moſt plainely, firſt we are taught that the chiefe vſe that we are to make of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie, is, thereby to attaine to haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Chriſt, and then as clearely he ſhewes vs (the better to prouoke vs to ſtriue to make that vſe thereof indeede) that God in his mercy hauing prouided e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life for vs, which we by the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> and our owne ſinnes had loſt, in his ſonne Chriſt Ieſus, that yet he would haue the caſe ſo ſtande with vs in reſpect
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:2586:78"/>thereof, that we can neuer haue that, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe we haue the ſonne himſelfe, in whom it is treaſured &amp; coffered vp for vs. Wherby queſtionleſſe the Lorde in his wiſedome, euen of loue towardes vs, hath ſo ordered the matter, for our verie beſt. For when <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue</hi> had life in their owne handes in paradice, we haue found by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience they very quickly loſt it. God ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hauing ſo coſtlie and dearely compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it againe for vs, by the death and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his owne welbe loued ſonne, he ſawe it in his wiſedome neither good nor ſafe for vs, liuing in this dangerous world, to truſt it any more in our owne handes: and therefore he that is the author and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſer thereof for vs, as he hath the beſt right therunto, by his appointment, hath it ſtill lodged for vs in himſelfe, and that ſo ſurely and inſeparably, that none euer ſhal or can be partaker thereof, but by the communication of his verie ſelfe firſt, and ſo once beeing ſure of him, then alſo he may withall be aſſured of the other. For theſe two now by Gods ordinance goe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ſo togither, that where Chriſt is had, there the partie in him is ſure of euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life, and where he is not had, there can be no aſſurance thereof. The bleſſed
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:2586:79"/>ſacrament of the bodie and blood of Chriſt was Inſtituted by him, euen of purpoſe, not onely to keepe ſtill freſh in our remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance his precious death, with all the fruites thereof, both generally and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, but alſo without all doubt, to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to deliuer and to feale the doliuery, to as many as rightly as they ſhould receiue the ſame, a moſt certaine vnion and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with whole and full Chriſt himſelfe. And to teach vs plainly ſo much, <hi>Paule</hi> ſaith 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16. <hi>The cup of bleſſing which we bleſſe, is it not the communion of the blood of Chriſt? the breade which we breake is it not the communion of the bodie of Chriſt?</hi> As cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely therefore as by bodily eating and drinking, in that ſacrament, or elſewhere, the eater and drinker of bread and wine, makes himſelfe partaker of all the force and goodneſſe therein, by making them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues firſt his owne, to the chearing and ſtrengthening of this life in the bodie: ſo by ſuch eating and drinking of the bodie broken, and blood ſhed for him of Chriſt (which are the thinges in this ſacrament ſignified and offered vnto him) as is fit to make ſuch foode his owne by, as verily the worthy and right receiuer in ſoule feedeth vpon, and is nouriſhed to eternall life, with
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:2586:79"/>the broken bodie, and bloodſhed of Chriſt Ieſus. And to aſſure al ſuch of this by Chriſt, the bread is faid to be his body broken, and the wine his blood ſhed, for the remiſſion of their fins: and both ſo termed and called by his ordinance broken and powred forth, are particularly to be giuen to euery ſuch communicant, and they are likewiſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue them: and therefore doubtleſſe thereby taught, not only by that which they ſee and he are in the adminiſtration herof; with thankfull and penitent hearts to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member his death, (and ſonowe therein, his bodie was broken, and his blood ſhed and ſeuered from his body, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe ſo handled, are the heauenly and ſpirituall foode prepared for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of their ſpirituall life before God,) but alſo by that which further is deliuered, and they receiue, that they are to aſſure themſelues, euerie one in particular, that Chriſt died for them, and therefore ſhall nouriſh and feede them to eternall life, by vniting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe moſt certainely vnto them, to that ende and purpoſe. Further yet to teach vs, that this moſte certaine and reall vnion with Chriſte is for the whole Church, and for the ſaluation thereof, moſt
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:2586:80"/>neceſſary, thoſe other metaphors alſo ſerue; whereby be is compated to the heade and husband of the Church, as of his bodie and wife, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.12. <hi>&amp; Cap.</hi> 5.32. or to the vine ſtocke, whereinto his heauenly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther engraſteth all thoſe branches, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſhall being forth much fruite, that he may be glorified, <hi>Io.</hi> 15.5.6.7.8. For here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are taught, that as it is with theſe, heade, husband, and ſtocke, in reſpect of the bodie, wife, and branches, ſo is it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Chriſt, and all thoſe that ſhall be ſaued. As therefore vnleſſe the head, really growe and be vnited to the bodie, yea though there can but a haire goe betwixt the one and the other, the bodie can haue no life from the head: and as mariage bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſummate, it maketh them that were ſtrangers before, one bodie, one fleſh, yea one ſelfe fame. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.28.29. and that otherwiſe vnperfected, it hath no ſuch effect: and laſtly, as it is not inough for the braunches to touch the vine ſtocke, yea nothing to haue life from thence, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they ſo growe therin, that it and they be as it were one: euen ſo is it in this caſe, betwixt Chriſt and all thoſe that would be ſaued by him.

            <p>But to proceede,
<note place="margin">This vnio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, but ſpirituall.</note> this vnion of ours and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion with Chriſt, though it muſt be certain, reall, &amp; true, in refpect of the things to be vnited, yet in regard of the manner of vniting them, we muſt not imagine it to be any groſſe or earthly commixtion or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

For let a man fearch all the ſcriptures thorow, and an other communion and fellowſhip with
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:2586:82"/>Chriſt, whereupon ſaluation commeth, then that which is ſpirituall, he ſhall nether finde eyther promiſed, expected, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. In deede it was both promiſed, and thereupon expected, and performed, that Godhead and manhood ſhoulde be vnited togither in one perſon, that ſo man (who by ſinne had loſt his vnion, communion, and fellowſhip with God) might recouer the ſame againe in and by that perſon, and by that which he ſhould accompliſh in thoſe two natures for him. But as the perſonall vnion of theſe two natures in one Chriſt, (as by our Catholicke faith we are perſwaded) is reall, certaine and ſure, ſo we finde it, yet by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine ſenſe and reaſon, incomprehenſible, and yet by the power of the eternall ſpirite, by the ſame faith, we are taught vndoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to beleeue, it was ſo verily effected, for our euerlaſting good. A communicating of the merits of this Chriſt, God and man, vnto thoſe that belezue in him, by imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on there is, we knowe: <hi>For the righteouſnes of God is on all, and vpon all that beleene in him. Rom.</hi> 3.22. which is a righteouſnes that ſuch attaine vnto by faith in him, not made manifeſt by the lawe (as the inherent righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of our owne merits, if there were any ſuch, as men knowe is) as both in that
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:2586:83"/>verſe, and that which goeth before, is ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But without the inhabitation of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God proceeding both from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Sonne (the worke whereof faith is. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 6.29. <hi>&amp; Gal.</hi> 5.22.) we cannot attaine heereunto. Howbeit heere we talke not eyther of the vnion of the two natures in the perſon of one Chriſt, nor yet of his communicating of his merits vnto vs by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, nor of his dwelling in vs by his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: but of his owne vniting and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating of himſelfe both God and man vnto vs. For conſiſting of thoſe two natures, heere in my text he biddeth vs to come vnto him, and as I haue ſhewed, to drinke of him: which if once we duelie performe, then we withal euen thereby, are ſure of all the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits neceſſary to our ſaluation, that by any of theſe we may looke for. Now <hi>Paule</hi> when he ſpoke moſt plainely of this, ſaying, <hi>We are members of his body, of his fleſh, &amp; of his bones, Epheſ.</hi> 5.30. to aſſure vs that it is reall and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall, yea and moſt certaine in reſpect of the thinges to be vnited, Chriſt &amp; his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: yet within two verſes after he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth and ſaith, that it is a great myſtery that he ſpeaketh of, thereby alſo ſhewing, that in reſpect of the manner of vniting of them, it is ſupernaturall and vnſearchable
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:2586:83"/>by humaine ſen<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſe and reaſon: howbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it this is our comfort, that though we cannot conceiue it whiles we are heere; and our knowledge is vnperfect; that yet Chriſt our ſauiour to our vnſpeakeable conſolation hath tolde vs, that the day ſhall come when his ſhall knowe,

Further, to proone this our vnion with Chriſt to be ſpirituall, &amp; not any groſſe or carnal mingling or conioyning of him and vs togither, it verie well ſerueth,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:2586:84"/>that Chriſt him ſelfe in the fixt of <hi>Iohn,</hi> hath both abſolutely, and moſt confidently ſaide, <hi>verily verily I ſay vnto you, except yee eate the fleſh of the ſonne of man, and drinke his bloode, yee haue noe life in you. verſ.</hi> 53.

<pb n="150" facs="tcp:2586:85"/>a true vnion and communion with Chriſt both God and man. For as there is but one God, ſo the Apoſtle hath taught vs, <hi>There is but one mediator betweene God and man, the man Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. <hi>neither is there ſaluation in any other: for amongſt men, there is giuen no other name vnder heauen, whereby we muſt be ſaued:</hi> as <hi>Peter</hi> moſt ſtoutly aduouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. <hi>Act.</hi> 4.12. Whereupon it muſt needs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that eyther there was none ſaued before Chriſt was God and man, which was not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world was 4000. yeare old &amp; more (which once to imagine were moſt abſurd, and notoriouſly iniurious to all the godly Patriarkes, Prophets and others that liued in the time of the old Teſtament) or elſe that it is moſt certaine &amp; true that <hi>Paul</hi> hath taught (as it is indeed of ſuch) <hi>that they did all not onely eat ſacramental bread, &amp; drinke ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental drinke as we doe: but that they did eate the ſame ſpiritual meat &amp; drink the ſame ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual drink which was Chriſt, that we do.</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.3.4. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Chriſt therefore than hauing no manhood really, but only in the purpoſe and promiſe of God, it could not bee, that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then by the worke &amp; meanes of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God they fed vpon him, &amp; were vnited vnto him God &amp; man, which yet then was neceſſary for their ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Though therfore now he be come &amp; gone againe, in his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:2586:85"/>hoode out of the worlde vnto his father, in the higheſt heauens, which alſo ſhal containe him vnto the reſtitution of al things, as <hi>Peter</hi> hath taught vs, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.21. yet we know alſo that he is of that almighty power, that as his hauing not then yet take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mans nature, could not then ſtop the godly Patriarkes, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets from their neceſſary vnion &amp; commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with him God &amp; man: ſo much leſſe, he hauing taken it now, and hauing finiſhed the worke of our redemption, being riſen againe aſcended &amp; ſet at the right hand of his father, can the diſtance of place betwixt heauen and earth, hinder or let the grouth of this vnion betwixt him &amp; his. For we ſee the diſtance of place betwixt man and wife, or father and child, doth not looſe the knot, or impeach the vnion, that by mariage &amp; nature was before betwixt them. And we ſee &amp; find by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that though the head in ſituation and place be much aboue the feet, that yet by the means that but nature hath to vnite them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither there is ſuch an vnio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> betwixt them, that fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the head life is conueied down eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the ſoales of the feet: likewiſe in the miſtical body of Chriſt, though the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers be neuer ſo farre diſioyned &amp; ſeuered in place, yet that ſo little hindreth the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Saints, that <hi>Paul</hi> hath ſaid, <hi>we that are many, are one bread &amp; one body, bicauſe we al are partakers of one bread,</hi> 1. <hi>Co.</hi> 10.17</p>
            <pb n="152" facs="tcp:2586:86"/>
            <p>Seing therefore, by that which I haue ſaid it ſufficiently appeareth, that it is the wil &amp; pleaſure of God, that there ſhoulde bee a true and certaine vnion betwixt Chriſt and his Church, he being as he is almightie, and therefore perfectly able to doe whatſoeuer he will; let not the difficultie any way, or the incomprehenſiblenes of the bringing of it to paſſe, at all make vs to doubte of the truth of the thing. For (alas) ſo ſhorte is our reach in comprehending the wonderful workes of God, that though we be neuer ſo ſure that we haue ſoules euery one of vs vnited to our bodies, yet the manner how, we cannot conceiue therefore it being now made clere and apparant, that Chriſt here by ſaying <hi>drinke,</hi> hath taught vs to make him our very owne, and that this muſt bee, though moſt truly, yet after a ſpirituall manner; to proceede, it is neceſſary now to learne, how thus we may eate him and drinke him, and ſo make him our owne.
<note place="margin">To eat and drinke Chriſt, is to beleeue in him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And for this, we neede not ſeeke farre: for whereas, if Chriſt ſhould haue continued the manner of phraſe that he began with all, he both eaſily could, would, and ſhoulde haue ſaide in the next verſe, he that drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of mee: of purpoſe doubtleſſe to ſhewe vs, that to drinke him or of him, is nothing
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:2586:86"/>elſe indeede but rightly to beleeue in him he ſaith, he that beleeueth in mee as ſaith the ſcripture, &amp;c. And the verie ſame &amp; like courſe, hath he taken. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 35. of the former chapter. For hauing ſaide, <hi>he that commeth vnto me ſhall not hunger</hi> by and by in ſteade of ſaying, he that drinketh of mee, he addeth <hi>he that beleeueth in mee.</hi> And to the ſame ende it may well be noted, that in that chapter, the very ſame things, that are promiſed to the eater of his fleſh, and drinker of his blood, are alſo promiſed to the beleeuer in him: and likewiſe, ther, the ſame things that are threatned againſt the one, are threatned againſt the other, as if you compare the 45. verſe with the 39. and the 53. with the 64. yee ſhall ſoone per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue. Yea if one marke diligently Chriſts diſcourſe in that chapter, he ſhall eaſilye finde, that there, to aſſure vs that to eate his fleſh and to drinke his blood is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in him, he hath of ſet purpoſe ſtoode, both vpon the propoſition, and aſſumption, whereupon neceſſarilie, by the rules of right reaſoning, that muſt follow for the concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For firſt, there he dwelleth vpon this, that to eate the breade of life, is to beleeue in him, for that he is the breade of life <hi>Verſ.</hi> 35. &amp;c. and then he diſcendeth to this, but
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:2586:87"/>he that eateth the fleſh of the ſon of man &amp; drinketh his blood, eateth the breade of life, <hi>verſ.</hi> 54. for he ſhal haue eternal life: wheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon what can elſe follow but this, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to eate the fleſh of the ſon of man &amp; to drinke his blood, is to beleeue in him? But whom theſe things yet ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>notperſwade to be of this minde, let them further reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber that <hi>Iohn</hi> hauing ſaid, <hi>as many as receiue Chriſt are made the ſons of God, cap.</hi> 1.12. that immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, leſt we ſhould not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiue aright, what it is to receiue him he addeth, that is, euen they that beleeue in him. And let them alſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider that <hi>Paule</hi> praying that Chriſt might dwel in the hearts of the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> addeth ſtreight, to ſhew vs how that might bee, by ſaith. <hi>cap.</hi> 3.17. For but theſe two places well laid togither, pregna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly prooue that Chriſt is both got &amp; kept, receiued of vs &amp; continued in vs by faith. And let not any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> think, either that this is new doctrine of late deuiſed by vs, or that true faith is too weake thus to reach Chriſt, &amp; to make him ours. For firſt it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that <hi>Tertulian,</hi> who liued within 200. yeares after Chriſts birth, in his booke <hi>de re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrectione carnis, cap.</hi> 29. moſt plainely hath ſaid: <hi>Chriſtus eſt auditu deuorandus, &amp; intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecturuminandus, fide digerendus:</hi> that is, Chriſt is to be deuoured by hearing, to be chewed by vnderſtanding, to be digeſted by
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:2586:87"/>faith. And <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> who floriſhed about the 400. yeare, is both moſt plaine &amp; plentiful in this point. For in his 25. tract vpon <hi>Iohn,</hi> he ſaith. <hi>Quidparas dentem &amp; ventre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? crede &amp; manducaſti:</hi> Why prepareſt thou thy teeth &amp; belly? beleeue &amp; thou haſt eaten. And in the next, he writeth much to that purpoſe; for he ſaith there, <hi>Ad Chriſtu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> non ambulandocur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimus ſed credendo, non motu carnis ſed volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate cordis,</hi> that is, we runne to Chriſt, not by walking but by beleeuing, not by the motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the fleſh, but by the wil of the heart. Yea in plain tearms there alſo he ſaith, <hi>Credere in eu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, eſt manducare pane<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vinu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> to beleeue in him is to eat the bread of life. But in my opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> moſt notably he writeth to this end vpon occaſion of the Centurions co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to Chriſt in his 33. booke againſt <hi>Fauſtus</hi> the <hi>Manichee, cap.</hi> 8. ſaying. <hi>Accedant ad Ieſum, no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> carne ſed corde; non corporis praeſentia ſed fidei potentia:</hi> Let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> come to Ieſus, not with or in fleſh, but with or in heart, not by bodily preſence, but by the power of faith. Now teaching the other point alſo, that faith is not too weake thus to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend Chriſt, it is as plaine that he hath ſaide in his 50. tract vpon <hi>Iohn. Quomodo in coelum manu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mittam, vt ibi ſedentem teneam? fidem mitte &amp; tenuiſti; parentes tui tenuerunt carne, tu tene corde, quoniam Chriſtus abſens etiam praeſens eſt; niſi praeſens eſſet, à nobis teneri
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:2586:88"/>non poſſet, &amp;c.</hi> that is, How ſhal I ſtretch my hand into heauen, that I may holde him ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting there? Send thy faith, and thou haſt hold of him; the fathers held him in the fleſh, hold thou him in heart: for Chriſt abſent is alſo preſent: for vnleſſe he were preſent, he could not be held of vs. And how this ſhall be, he plainely ſheweth, ſaying, <hi>He is gone, and yet he is heere, for he caried his body into heauen, but his maieſtie he hath not taken from the worlde. Chriſoſtome</hi> alſo, an other ancient father, who liued much what about <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines time,</hi> in his ſecond Homilie vpon theſe wordes of <hi>Eſay, Vidi Dominum,</hi> I haue ſeene the Lord, ſheweth that though we cannot flie vp to heauen in bodie, that yet in minde and cogitation we may. For God (ſaith he) hath giuen that ſuch winges that nothing can let or ſtop it, if it will flie to heauen; &amp; farre more pearcing eies, God hath giuen it (ſaith he) then the body. And in his 24. Homilie vpon the firſt to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring there that ſaying of Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.28. <hi>Where the carion is, thither will the Eagles reſort,</hi> thereupon he inferreth, that the Lordes table is not for Iayes or Crowes, that feede belowe, but for <hi>Eagles</hi> that take their meate aloft: &amp; he ſaith, that by hat ſpeach, Chriſthath taught them that
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:2586:88"/>would come vnto his body to flie aloft, and not to creepe vpon the earth, nor yet to haue any dealing therewith. It is worthy the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring alſo, that the ſame Father no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, touching the power and force of faith, vpon <hi>Paules</hi> telling the <hi>Galathians,</hi> That <hi>Chriſt was euen crucified amongſt them. Cap.</hi> 3.1. For he plainely ſheweth that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in ſo ſaying, ſhewed them that the ſtrength of faith was ſuch, that it is able to ſee thinges though farre off, and ſo by the eies of faith in the miniſtrie of the worde and ſacraments which had beene amongſt thoſe <hi>Galathians,</hi> Chriſtes death was or might haue beene as clearely ſeene and more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, then it was of many that were preſent at it. And vnto <hi>Bernards</hi> time, who liued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue 1100 yeares after Chriſt, it ſeemeth that this was the currant and receiued do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church, touching our commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to be had and attained vnto with Chriſt by faith. For in his 28. Homilie vpon the <hi>Canticles</hi> he moſt plainely ſheweth, that though Chriſt be aſcended, that yet he both may and will be touched, <hi>Sed affectu, non manu, voto non oculo, fide non ſenſibus,</hi> but then (ſaith he) it muſt be by affection, and not by hand, by deſire and not by eye, by faith and not by the ſenſes. And againe in
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:2586:89"/>his 76. ſermon vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>Canticles,</hi> moſt notable is it that he writeth to this purpoſe, ſaying, <hi>Though Chriſt be ſet at the right hand of his Father, goe to yet, follow him, ſeeke him,</hi> and let neyther his inacceſſable brightneſſe, nor his height diſcourage thee from ſeeking, or once cauſe thee to diſpaire of finding him, if thou canſt beleeue; all things are poſſible to the beleeuer, the word is neare to my mouth and heart: <hi>Crede &amp; inueniſti, nam credere inueniſſe eſt,</hi> that is, Beleeue and thou haſt found him, for to beleeue is to haue found him. This admirable power of faith doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe is excellently aduouched <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1. whiles there it is defined to be the ground of things which are hoped for, and the euidence of things which are not ſeene. Wherefore let vs not once doubt, but where Chriſt is ſoundly and rightly beleeued in, there by that faith the owner thereof eateth his fleſh, and drinketh his blood to his or her eternall ſaluation.

            </p>
            <p>Yet then great need and care is to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, that this faith of ours be ſound &amp; right.

For they are the ſcriptures onely without all queſtion, that heere are ſpoken of. But whether theſe words, <hi>as ſaith the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> here were added and vſed to this end, or rather as ſome others take them as referred to the wordes following, to teach vs to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the promiſe that followeth, moſt certaine it is that the true Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> faith, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we muſt feede vpon Chriſt and make him with all his merits and graces our owne, hath theſe canonicall ſcriptures of the olde and new Teſtament for the grounde and ſufficient rule thereof. For they onely are able to make a man wiſe to ſaluarion thorow the faith which is in Chriſt Ieſus, <hi>and are giuen by inſpiration of God, and are profitable to teach, to conuince, to correct and to inſtruct in righteouſneſſe, that the man of God may be abſolute beeing made perfect vnto all good workes,</hi> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15.16.17.

<note place="margin">Andridius Ecchius: Lindan.

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:2586:93"/>to be vnder the Church, then to haue au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie ouer her, that it were a pittiful thing if the Church ſhould be tied to the Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall ſcriptures in euerie thing to be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and oueruled thereby, eye that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not noreuer will be well with the Church as long as the lay people are ſuffered to read them, or to heare them red: for they are ſo obſcure, and their ſenſe is ſo flexible and heard to be found (ſay they) that thence all hereſies are ſuckt, and that their ſenſe is as but a leaden rule or a noſe of waxe vnleſſe it be ſtifned, ſtreighted and kept euen by the helpe of their traditions.

What greater blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies can be vttered againſt the maieſtie of God the author of theſe ſcriptures? For he hauing left them vnto his Church, in his good prouidence by his penmen for hir better direction to know his will, and then to beleeue and liue accordingly, (as out of all doubt he haith) how may we thinke without doing of him the greateſt wrong that may be, that he hath left it therein no perfecter a rule then they hold, to this end?
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:2586:94"/>For were not this in effect to ſay, that ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he could not for lacke of power, skill, and wiſedome, or that elſe he would not for lacke of loue and care towardes it, make it any ſufficienter and certamer? For what reaſon elſe can there be that he ſhould vndertake, begin &amp; goe forward as he hath with ſuch a rule for the direction therof, and yet leaue it when he hath done, ſo maimed and ſo vnprofitable as they would make it? Now to haue but eyther of theſe conceites of God, were it not moſt abſurde and iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious vnto him? For how can we ſpoile him either of infinite wiſedome, or of infinite and moſt perfect loue &amp; care to wardes his Church, but withall we plainely denie him to be the true God? Wherfore let vs, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foeuer theſe men ſay to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary, learne to beleeue as onely the canonical ſcriptures of God teach vs; &amp; to that end &amp; purpoſe, let vs now as briefly as we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, take a view what they do teach vs in this reſpect &amp; behalfe.</p>
            <p>Concerning this point,
<note place="margin">What faith the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture heere requireth.</note> firſt it is out of doubt, whatſoeuer the Lord hath taught or told for trueth in theſe canonicall ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, we are moſt firmely by faith to aſlent vnto, to be ſo, and therefore hereof, howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer to diſcredit vs withall the papiſtes would ſeeme to the contrary, we neither
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:2586:94"/>make nor moue any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſie with them. Yea we moſt heartily wiſh and pray, that as they define faith to be a firme aſſent to the whole reuealed wil of God by his word, that once it would pleaſe God to giue them but this faith, to aſſent in deed without wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering to that which he hath taught in his written word in the canonicall ſcriptures: for then all the controuerſies betwixt them &amp; vs would ſtreight be at an end. But alas they enforce ſuch a ſenſe vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe ſcriptures &amp; ſo equal their vnwritte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> word of traditions herwith, that as long as they take this courſe there is no hope that euer they either can or wil haue this grace: wherfore to leaue them a while, grounded farre more vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their own vnwritten traditions, then vpon the canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſcriptures for the ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of their faith, the next thing that we are to vnderſtand touching faith is, that when it is ſpoken of, as it is here in my text, it importeth more then this general aſſent to al trueth taught in the canonical ſcriptures. For that brings one no further then <hi>credere Deo, Deum, &amp; de Deo,</hi> that is, to beleeue or credit God, &amp; to beleeue that he is, &amp; what he is, wheras here in my text expreſly Chriſt ſaith, <hi>he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeueth in me,</hi> thereby requiring that we ſhould not thinke it inough to beleeue him as a ſpeaker alwaies of trueth, or to beleeue
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:2586:95"/>that he is ſuch a one in perſon &amp; office, as I haue ſhewed him to be, (for both theſe he hath already ſufficiently called for at our hands in bidding of vs come vnto him) but that it is neceſſarie for vs, if we would haue him to be our meat &amp; drinke indeed, to goe yet further, that is, to beleue in him. Which is indeed (the former leſſons being wel taken out) therupon as vpon a moſt ſound founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to ground a moſt certaine truſt &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, that in, for, through, and by him, whollie and ſolie, freely &amp; ſullie we ſhalbe iuſtified heere, and ſaued heere after. To all the former degrees of faith, the reprobate and ſuch as are deſtitute fo the graces of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation &amp; ſanctification yea the verie diuels may come, namely to yeald that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing is as God hath ſaid it to be in his written word, to credit him bicauſe he is trueth it ſelf, &amp; to beleue that he is, &amp; that he is alſo ſuch a one as he therin ſets forth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to bee, &amp; this may therfore make them to tremble, as <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith, 2.19. But this is not the faith of Gods elect, that <hi>Paule</hi> ſpeakes of, to <hi>Titus cap.</hi> 1. nor that, which he ſaith worketh by charitie. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6. nor that which is ſaid, purifieth the heart. <hi>Act.</hi> 15.9. nor that whereof it is ſo often and ſo vniuerſally ſaid, <hi>Whoſoeuer beleeueth in him, ſhall not periſh, but hane eternall
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:2586:95"/>life. Io.</hi> 3.15. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Neceſſary it is that Gods elect haue all theſe degrees and branches of faith, and the beleeuing thus farre is alwaies found in them before they can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in Ieſus Chriſt ſo as that through him they can haue any aſſurance of their ſaluation: but if they will haue ſuch a faith whereby in Chriſt Ieſus they ſhall be iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, then they muſt nor ſtay in theſe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralities, but they muſt ſet Chriſt with all his graces neceſſarie for either their iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation or ſaluation before them, and by imbracing and applying him particularly vnto them, &amp; all that euer he did for mans ſaluation, as euen done particularly &amp; moſt certainly forthe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; in him and by him ſo made theirs, they are to be aſſured that God hath freely iuſtified the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; vndoubtedly alſo will ſaue them. For though euery trueth taught by God in his word be the general obiect of faith, yet the proper obiect therof, by appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> where of it is ſo oft ſaid in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to iuſtifie, is onely Chriſt Ieſus, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is not inough for faith with her inward eies to know and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe to be as he is in perſon and office as you haue before heard, but as you may ſufficiently perceiue by Chriſtes ſetting of himſelfe before the faithfull as the meate and drinke of their ſoules, and
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:2586:96"/>by his requiring, that they ſhould hunger and thirſt after him, yea eate him &amp; drinke him, &amp; then by his plaine expounding that eating &amp; drinking of him to be beleeuing in him, he is by faith to be taken &amp; appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to euery right beleeuer in him. And to put it out of doubt, that the iuſtifying faith or faith in Chriſt Ieſus, muſt haue and indeed hath this effect, <hi>Paule</hi> after he had willed the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to proue &amp; try them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues whether they were in the faith, hee ſtreight addeth, <hi>And examine your ſelues, know you not your own ſelues that Ieſus Chriſt is in you, vnleſſe you be reprobates?</hi> 2. <hi>Co.</hi> 13.5. when faith thus apprehendeth Chriſt, &amp; ſo poſſeſſeth her owner of him, as that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf may know that Chriſt is in him, how ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it be then but he that hath by faith ſo found and got Chriſt, hath alſo in him &amp; by him a ſpecial aſſurance that his ſins are forgiuen him, &amp; that vndoubtedly he ſhall for that Chriſts ſake be ſaued? when it doth all this we denie not, but moſt willingly we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that there it bringeth forth by the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of the ſpirit of ſanctification, good works plentifully in her owner; but yet we dare not ſay that it iuſtifieth either for the worthineſſe of it ſelfe, or for the worthines of all the noble traine of good works inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perablie

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying it, but onely for the worthines of Ieſus Chriſt, whom it apprehendeth.

And let vs confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conclude with Saint <hi>Paule,</hi> that <hi>beeing iuſtified by faith, we haue peace with God, through Ieſus Chriſt, by whom alſo we haue acceſſe through faith vnto his grace, wherein we ſtand and reioyce vnder the hope of the glory of God, yea with that hope, that ſhall neuer ſhame or confound vs. Rom.</hi> 5.1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For whatſoeuer our aduerſaries ſay or feele to the contrary in themſelues, we that can finde once by faith, that we haue put on Chriſt, that we haue eaten his fleſh and drunke his blood, yea that he is euen in vs, and therefore haue firſt Gods promiſes of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten declared and made vnto vs, and then the ſame particularly, outwardly in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and inwardly in our ſoules by his ſpirit thus ſealed and applied vnto vs, dare boldly with Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſay, that we know we are tranſlated from death to life. 1. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 3.14. and with Saint <hi>Paule, that we are perſwaded that nothing ſhall euer ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate vs from the loue of God which is in Chriſt Ieſus. For ſeeing he hath not ſpared to beſtow his owne ſonne vpon vs, how ſhall he not with him giue vs all things elſe. Rom.</hi> 8.13.39. yea we are ſure it is no preſumption
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:2586:97"/>to beleeue God without any wauering, thus many waies teſtifying his effectuall mercy &amp; loue to appertaine euen vnto vs: eye we know it were wickedly to call the trueth and faithfulneſſe of God into que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, once to doubt when he ſo many waies hath ſought to put vs out of al doubt. No maruel though the papiſtes can attaine vnto no ſuch ioy and peace or aſſurance in their conſciences of ſaluation by their faith. For firſt they build as much of their faith vpon the ſandie foundation of their owne traditions, as vpon the rocke of the canonicall ſcriptures: ſecondly the faith that they talke on, leades them no further then to a generall aſtent to all trueth reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by God vnto man in his word, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in particular they neyther thinke the knowledge of all that trueth neceſſary, nor yet the ſpeciall application of the promiſes to any, contenting themſelues with belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in generall, that there is in the Church remiſſion of ſinnes purchaſed by Chriſt, &amp;c. And thirdly they hold there is no ſuch faith whereby, in, &amp; for Chriſt the owner therof can come to any ſuch aſſura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the mercy of God, of the forgiuenes of his ſins, and of life euerlaſting: yea that that is rather a preſumption, &amp; a mere fiction and inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:2586:98"/>then any faith allowed of God, vnleſſe God giue a man a ſpeciall reuelation, as it were telling him by name in particular, that he ſhall haue theſe in deed for Chriſts ſake: and that therefore it is inough for to beleeue that their are theſe things in deede by Chriſt purchaſed. And therfore laſtly they holde that faith may be in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate, and that it is ſaid to iuſtifie one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bicauſe it is one of the firſt diſpoſitions to iuſtification, and that it iuſtifieth not ſo much for apprenending Chriſt the iuſtifier, as for that it obtaineth that Chriſt ſhoulde formally iuſtify her owner, by powring into him the grace of charity, whereby he may after be able more to iuſtifie himſelf, and to merite the kingdome of heauen by good works. So that in effect they hold &amp; teach, that it iuſtifieth not for Chriſt apprehended &amp; applied to her owner, but for charitie and other good works that Chriſt by his grace, for the worthineſſe therof, beſtoweth vpon him quite contrary to the ſcriptures; which as we haue heard, ſhut workes quite out from this office of iuſtifying and purchaſing of ſaluation for man. Whereas they know further that the ſame ſcriptures put a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt difference betwixt this righteouſneſſe of the law that lies in doing, and that which
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:2586:98"/>we haue to make vs righteous by, by ſaith in Chriſt Ieſus. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.5. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.12. And yet euen their great Doctor <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> neither is nor will be aſhamed of any of this their doctrine of faith, and in this laſt point, though he be enforced to graunt that we are firſt iuſtified freely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out workes in Chriſt Ieſus, and that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen alſo is Gods childrens by adoption and inheritance: yet the formall cauſe of our iuſtification muſt be with him the infuſed habite of charitie, and good workes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter done muſt make vs to haue a ſecond right vnto the kingdome of heauen, and ſo to further degrees of glory there, by the way of wages and iuſt debt. Though for all this, when he hath done his beſt for the maintenance of this ſecond title and right thereunto, he dare not teach any with any ſpecial aſſurance &amp; confidence that cannot deceiue them, to truſt thereunto. Nay theſe things thus being moſt certainly held and taught by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> touching the nature of faith quite contrary to the ſcriptures, I can neuer maruaile that by their faith there is bred no certainner hope or confidence in them of Gods mercie, or of the forgiueneſſe of their ſinnes, or of anie thing elſe that appertaines to ſaluation, then as

For whiles thus they pleade and ſtand vpon a wrong title, and would alſo beare men in hand that a ſpeciall ende and vſe of Chriſtes comming was, not to procure them ſufficient title and right to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen, in, and by himſelfe and thinges done and ſuffered by and in his owne perſon, but to inable them by theſe meanes to make themſelues to haue a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, a better &amp; further title thereunto, they are moſt worthy to looſe al the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort that they might haue, if they would ſtand to the right and onely good title, by and for Ieſus Chriſtes ſake alone.

I know they haue their colours and ſophiſtical deuiſes to giue yet ſuch a gloſſe and faire ſhewe to this their dealing, as though for all this all were very well of their ſides: but all they can gaine therby is this, that ſo much the more they proue their religion to be aptlie and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily tearmed by the Apoſtle, <hi>the miſtrie of iniquitie.</hi> 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.7. and that the proud and pompeous whore of <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhoulde haue that worde <hi>Myſterie,</hi> ſet for her very brand and marke in her forehead, and that ſhe ſhould yet carie al her abhominations and fornications, wherewith ſhe ſhoulde make the inhabitantes of the world drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, in a golden cup, the ſooner to entiſe them to drinke deepely thereof.

For how can they be ſo ſillie and ſimple, as to imagine indeede that in this great light any can &amp; wil be ſo
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:2586:101"/>fooliſh as hearing what they doe, ſo plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and plentifully ſet downe euerie where in the doctrine of the goſpell, that Chriſt went thorow effectually in his owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with the worke of our redemption and ſaluation, as once to be drawne by their ſophiſticall perſwaſions, that yet what he hath done, ſerueth eſpecially but to merit that chantie firſt ſhould be beſtowed vpon vs: and then that thereunto, &amp; to our good workes proceeding therefrom, ſhould be conuaied from his merits a dignitie and power, firſt formally to iuſtifie vs by the one, which we could not bee by the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of him and his merites vnto vs thorow faith, and then after to earne and merite more ſurelie for vs by the other, the kingdom of heauen, then he had done? For they may prate and brag, that whiles they thus ſay and teach, they attribute more to the merits of Chriſt than we doe, that both for our iuſtification and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation truſt onelie thereunto; but eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie man for all that, vnder theſe fayre wordes may plainely ſee, that in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie deede they heereby moſt groſſelie woulde make him, as I ſaide before, the verie principall in the robbing of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe of that ſpeciall honor that is his, to be

But he that made vs, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth what is in vs, and by experience we finde how neceſſarie ſo euer it be for vs to beleeue the word of God, that yet though we haue it (as in the goodneſſe of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes vs we haue) both written, and thus ſealed and confirmed by his Sacraments, that all this is little inough to make vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue it as we ſhould. Wherefore ſeeing it hath pleaſed God to ſtoupe ſo lowe vnto vs, &amp; thus to apply himſelf to our capacity, let vs in the name of God praiſe him ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and moſt thankfully take vſe of all the meanes that he hath left vs to get vnto his ſonne by. And therefore giue me leaue heere to enlarge my ſelfe a little vnto you, that there be nothing wanting in mee to ſhew you, or to helpe you forward, by the helpe of theſe Sacramentes, that I ſpeake of, through the working of Gods ſpirite in your heartes withall, more and more to come vnto Chriſt, and to be v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited vnto him to your euerlaſting ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And the rather becauſe I know as the right vnderſtanding of the nature thereof may by Gods bleſſing mightilie helpe you or ward therein; ſo eyther the ignorance
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:2586:107"/>thereof, or an erroneous conceite of them may verie much hinder you in the ſame. Sacraments I call them, according to the ancient vſe, and phraſe of the Church: which name I take was at the firſt bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from an ancient faſhion of making a ſolemne vow and couenant betwixt the Emperour and his ſouldiers, whereby he was bound to them to goe in and out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them as an Emperour, &amp; they bound themſelves vnto him againe to be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and obedient ſouldiers. And therefore becauſe in theſe ſacred rites it was obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that likewiſe there paſſeth a ſolemne couenant betwixt God and the worthie receiuers thereof, it was thought that not vnfitly they might be called Sacraments. And in verie deede, whether we conſider Baptiſme or that other of the bodie and blood of Chriſt, we ſhall eaſily finde that thereby this is done. For in Baptiſme, the miniſter in the name of GOD offereth by baptiſing in water, in the name of the Father, the Sonne, and the holie Ghoſt, vnto the partie baptized not onelie a figure &amp; repreſentation of the waſhing away of his ſinnes and of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation in the bloode of Chriſt, but alſo a viſible and ſenſible ſeale thereof,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:2586:107"/>whereby God bindeth himſelfe to doe all this for the partie, if the let and ſtoppe thereof be not in himſelfe: and he likewiſe by receiuing this Sacrament maketh o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen profeſſion, that he will liue and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue accordingly. And in the other when breade and wine, called as they be, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered vnto the communicant, in like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner then God offereth to feede that partie to eternall life, with the bodie broken and blood ſhed of his ſon: and he, by taking of them, makes open confeſſion that he ſo beleeueth and therefore will ſo ſhew it in his life therafter: and of this mutuall coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant the ſacrament deliuered and receiued is a moſt certaine pledge and ſeale be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them. It ſtandes therefore euery one in hand, that receiue theſe Sacraments to haue a greate care, not onelie to beleeue that GOD for his parte will performe that which thereby he bindeth himſelfe vnto: but alſo for their partes to fulfill that, whereunto they tie themſelues: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe ſure they are no better than diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblers before men, and hypocrites be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore GOD. If the Etimologie of this worde Sacrament, be but conſidered, it might teach vs in an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="192" facs="tcp:2586:108"/>that is, with a ſacred and a holy minde. The worde is taken and vſëd ſo generally often, that euery outward thing by Gods ordinance ſignifying a further grace or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite, hath beene called a Sacrament. And therfore <hi>Iohn Chapp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>s</hi> in his Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary vpon <hi>Raymunds</hi> ſumme of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <hi>tract.</hi> 1. thought he had found in <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go de ſancto victore</hi> in his ſixt booke of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, a verie perfect definition of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, when he found that he defined it to be, <hi>Naturale elementum extrinſecùs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culis ſuppoſitum, ex inſtitutione figurans, ex ſimilitudine repraeſentans, &amp; ex ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one aliquam gratiam inuiſibilem conferens:</hi> that is, A naturall element ſet outwardly before the eyes, by inſtitution figuring, by ſimilitude repreſenting, and by ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication conferring ſome inuiſible grace. And in verie deede, it ſomewhat well reſtraineth the ouerlarge vſe of the word: and there is nothinge therein but it is true of Sacraments properly taken as I take them now. But to make it fully to expreſſe the nature of a ſacrament thus taken, and noe more, I woulde thereunto adde, (and I am ſure it ought to be ſo) that the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutor muſt bee God himſelfe; that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time the outward partis not onely one ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:2586:108"/>to be ſeene with the eies, but more then one: and that it is not enough that by ſanctification it conferre any viſible grace whatſoeuer, but that that grace be euen Chriſt himſelfe with ſuch graces as in him re prouided for our ſaluation. And therfore I define a Sacrament, as nowe I ſpeake thereof, to be <hi>A viſible ſigne or ſignes, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by Chriſt, to be miniſtred in his Church to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that be his, not only to figure &amp; repreſent himſelfe and what he hath done for their ſaluation; but alſo whereby to offer himſelfe with grace neceſſarie to ſaluation, and to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer himſelfe with the ſame, and to ſeale the communication and deliuerie thereof, to euery worthy receiuer of the outward element or ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, according to his inſtitution.</hi> And ſuch we finde no more now in the newe Teſtament, but Baptiſme and the Lordes Supper. The other fiue vrged as Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> of our daies, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer in ſome generall &amp; improper ſenſe they maybe ſo called, in this they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not. For ſome one or other neceſſary thing mentioned in this definition is wanting in euery one of them. And yet there is nothing in this definition that can be omitted, if we minde ſo to define or deſcribe a Sacrament as that indeed truely, and fully, we meane
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:2586:109"/>to expreſſe the nature thereof as it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon but to theſe two, Baptiſme and the Supper. To the conſtitution therefore of a Sacrament by this we may ſee that it is firſt neceſſarie, that Chrſt be the author and inſtitutor thereof. Secondly, that there haue a commandement paſſed from him to adminiſter it in his Church. Thirdlie, that it conſiſt of ſuch outward viſible element or elementes, as he hath choſen and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for that purpoſe. And fourthly, that according to his ordinance they be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken as meanes to put him on by, and to make him ours, with all ſuch graces as in him are prouided for our ſaluation. So that asto the making of a perfect ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there muſt concurre bodie and ſoule in one; and to the being of our Chriſt to be a fit perſon to be our Meſſias and Sauiour, Godhead &amp; man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood: ſo to the full beeing of a Sacrament according to Chriſts ordinance, an outward element or elements, and Chriſt himſelfe and his grace fit and needfull for our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation are neceſſary. And therefore as neither bodie &amp; ſoule in man, nor God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head &amp; manhood in Chriſt without falling into a groſſe errour there about, can or may be ſaid or thought to be eyther confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the other, or annihilated or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorpted
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:2586:109"/>ſorpted of the other: ſo neyther may we ſay or thinke of theſe two partes in a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. When therefore we come to receiue any Sacrament; as outwardly we receiue the outward element, ſo inwardly we muſt ſeeke to receiue alſo the heauenly thing thereby offered vnto vs: or elſe by our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault we ſeuere thoſe thinges which we ſhould coupple, and as much as lyeth in vs, ouerthrowe the nature and vſe of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</p>
            <p>Nowe to deſcend from the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Sacrament thus in generall,
<note place="margin">Of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme.</note> to theſe two particuler Sacramentes: In Baptiſme which is the firſt, we haue Chriſtes ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for it, and commaundement alſo for the miniſtring of it. <hi>Math.</hi> 28.19. where Chriſt ſaid vnto his diſciples; <hi>Goe and teach all nations, baptiſing them in the name of the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghoſt.</hi> And thereby alſo the worde <hi>baptiſe</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying, as it doth, to dippe in water or therewith to ſprinkle, we may ſee the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward element to be water. Which is alſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed by al the practiſe of the Churches in the Apoſtles times: as appeares both in the ſtorie of their Actes written by Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> and elſewhere. And that the thing therby ſignified, offered, &amp; deliuered
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:2586:110"/>is Chriſt himſelfe, and ſo in him remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſinnes, regeneration and dying to ſinne, and liuing againe vnto righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſpeſſe, it ſufficiently appeareth in theſe places of the Scriptures. <hi>Knowe ye not that all we which haue beene baptiſed into Chriſt, haue beene baptiſed into his death? we are then buried with him by Baptiſme into his death, that like as Chriſt was rayſed vp from the dead to the glory of the Father, ſo we alſo ſhould walke in newnes of life. Rom.</hi> 6.3.4. <hi>All ye that are baptiſed into Chriſt haue put on Chriſt. Gal.</hi> 3.27. <hi>Be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed euery one of you in the name of Ieſus Chriſt for the remiſſion of ſinnes, Act.</hi> 2.38. <hi>Chriſt loued the Church, and gaue himſelfe for it, that he might ſanctifie it and cleanſe it, by the waſhing of water through the word &amp;c. Ephe.</hi> 5.25.26. <hi>According to his mercie he ſaued vs, by the waſhing of the new birth, and renewing of the holy Ghoſt, Tit.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme that now is, ſaueth vs by the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that are deſirous not onely to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted baptiſed with the outward Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme of water, muſt as you ſee accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Paules</hi> counſell, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.14. <hi>put on the Lord Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe, and take no thought for the fleſh to fulfill the luſtes of it.</hi>
               <pb n="197" facs="tcp:2586:110"/>For if they be partakers of the other part thereof, in the blood of Chriſt, they are waſhed and cleansed: and ſo muſt, and are bound to liue as men dead to ſinne and aliue to righteouſneſſe. Baptiſme ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Is a Sacrament of the new Teſtament, wherein by beeing dipped in, or ſprinkled vpon with water, in the name of the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghoſt, we are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured that God the Father can and will in the blood, and by the blood of his Sonne, by the mighty working of the holy Ghoſt, waſh away our ſins, and ſo receiue vs and incorporate vs into his Church, that we ſhal be his new borne children and inabled to be holy, becauſe he is holy.</hi> We adminiſter it to infants becauſe it ſucceedeth Circumciſion: which was by Gods ordinance appointed to be miniſtred to the infants of the Iewes, when they were but eight daies old, <hi>Ge.</hi> 17.12. becauſe Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Suffer little children to come vnto me, for of ſuch is the kingdom of heauen. Mat.</hi> 19.13. becauſe we read that the Apoſtles baptiſed whole houſeholds, as <hi>Act.</hi> 16.33. amongeſt which ſometimes it is moſt likelie there were ſome infantes: and laſtly, becauſe we finde that God promiſed not onelie to be the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but alſo of his feede after him. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. and that
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:2586:111"/>Saint <hi>Paule</hi> moſt plainely teacheth, that if one of the parents be beleeuing, then is the ſeede holy. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. And therefore it beeing adminiſtred to ſuch, and in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and in that manner that it is by Chriſts ordinance, the nature of water beeing as we knowe it to bee; we may and ought to learne all theſe leſſons, that we are all borne and conceiued in ſinne, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſo defiled that we ſtand need of waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: that this waſhing and cleanſeing is to be had at God the Fathers hands, through Ieſus Chriſt, by the working of the holie Ghoſt, and no where elſe: that God both can and will thus waſh and cleanſe vs, and that therefore this Trinitie in vnitie is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be beleeued in and truſted vnto for the matter of our ſaluation, and to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured in all thankfulneſſe for the ſame, by our ceaſing from ſinne and doing of that which is good. Whereupon we ſee, that they that would lead vs after we haue once beene thus baptiſed, to put our faith and confidence for any part of our forgiuenes of ſinnes or ſaluation eyther in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſon or thing as the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon faſhion is amongſt papiſtes, doubtleſſe they would haue vs to reuolt from that faith wherein we were baptiſed, and whereunto therby
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:2586:111"/>we haue moſt ſolemnly bound our ſelues. Heereby alſo we may perceiue that though Baptiſme it ſelfe be but once to be miniſtred for the reaſon before ſhewed: yet as oft as euer eyther we finde our ſinnes rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to ſhake our faith, or otherwiſe to trouble vs, by meditation thereof we are thus to haue our recourſe againe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, to the ſtrengthening both of our faith, and to the weakning of the power of ſinne, (howſoeuer the papiſtes would perſwade vs, that it ſerueth onely to aſſure vs of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſinnes before;) becauſe we may be ſure that God is alwaies readie, if we can beleeue in him, to performe vnto vs whatſoeuer he hath offered vnto vs therein. Which doubtleſſe is the remiſſion of all our ſinnes before or after, we beleeuing and repenting thereof. Or elſe if onely thereby were offered forgiueneſſe of ſinnes before it; then ſurely the Church would haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred it to the laſt, or later then eyther it hath or yet doth.</p>
            <p>And as for the other Sacrament,
<note place="margin">Of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</note> if we doe with any diligence but conſider that which we finde ſet downe thereof. <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.26. <hi>&amp;c. Mar.</hi> 14.22. <hi>&amp;c. Luk.</hi> 22.19. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we ſhall there finde, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer appertaineth eyther generally to a
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:2586:112"/>Sacrament, or particularly vnto it moſt plainely and effectually expreſſed. For there it is euident that Chriſt inſtituted it, and commanded his miniſters to adminiſter it vntill his comming againe: that he ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned very bread and wine to be the outward viſible elements: and his bodie broken for his, and his blood ſhed for the remiſſion of their ſinnes, to be the things by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther figured, ſignified and repreſented; yea, thereby both offered and truely deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered and communicated to the right and worthy receiuer: And therefore to aſſure the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of as much, he called the bread broken &amp; diſtributed, his body broken: &amp; the wine powred forth &amp; giuen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the cup, his blood of the new Teſtament, ſhed for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to the remiſſion of their ſins. We there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by warrant from hence do define this: <hi>To be a Sacrament of the new Teſtament, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by Chriſt, and to adminiſtred by his ordinance, and to be receiued according to the ſame of his faithfull people, conſiſting not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of bread broken &amp; wine powred out into the cup, to be diſtributed &amp; receiued of al wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy commers thereunto in remembrance of his death and paſſion; and as vndoubted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens by his inſtitution (though not of their own nature) both that his body was broken, and his
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:2586:112"/>blood ſhed for all his in general, and alſo parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly for the full redemption and ſaluation of euery right receiuer hereof: but alſo of the very broken body and bloodſhed of Chriſt, for our ſaluation therewith all as certainely offred to be fed on to eternall life, and fed on indeed by euery worthy communicant (though by ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall meanes) as the other are offered vnto them, taken and fed on by the inſtruments of the bodie.</hi> Whereupon moſt earneſtly we exhort euery one that would worthily come vnto this table, and ſo be partakers indeed to their comfort of this Sacrament, with Saint <hi>Paule</hi> in any caſe to trie and examine themſelues firſt, and to iudge themſelues, leaſt for want of ſo doing they be heere iudged of the Lord by ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of this breade and drinking of this cup vnworthily to haue made themſelues guiltie of his bodie and bloode, and ſo to eate and drinke their own damnation. For though we holde breade and wine heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſtill to retaine their former ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and eſſence; becauſe euen by the expreſſe wordes of the inſtitution in the places before quoated ſo much is euident, and the common nature of a Sacrament requireth the continuance of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde element in his former nature that
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:2586:113"/>ſo it may carrie the better and apterreſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of the thing whoſe name it beareth: yet we know and moſt willingly confeſſe with all antiquitie, that thereof heere by vertue of Chriſtes inſtitution, (which doth and ſhal remaine in force ſtil to the worlds end alwaies to effect the ſame in bread and wine according to his ordinance ſet aſide and vſed to this purpoſe) there is a verie great change and alteration. But that is but in name, vſe, and eſtimation. For whereas before they were but called bread and wine, and ſerued but to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vſe of the nouriſhing and cheering of the bodie, and therefore ſo onely were to be eſteemed: heerein they beare the names of the verie bodie and bloode of Chriſt, and they ſerue as the Lordes good meanes to lead and ſtrengthen our faith to feede therupon indeed to our ſaluation:
<note place="margin">The vſe thereof.</note> and therefore we eſteeme of them herein, not as they are of their owne nature, but as they are by his inſtitution, ſacred ſignes, ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols, repreſentations, ſimilitudes, pledges, and ſeales of thoſe thinges whoſe names they beare. And therefore we call vpon you moſt earneſtly, whenſoeuer you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, in the feare of God reuerently ſo to take them: and ſo by marking what is ſaid
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:2586:113"/>of them and done with them, to take occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, firſt to call effectually to your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance how Chriſts body was broken with ſorrowes and tormentes, and his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious blood ſhed and ſeuered in his paſſion from his body to ſatisfie the iuſtice of God his heauenly father for mans ſinnes, yea euen for euery one of your ſinnes; and therefore withall heartily to ſorrowe for your ſinnes that put him to al theſe paines, and yet vnſainedlie alſo with thankefull heartes to reioyce, that he woulde take ſuch paines for them that were ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy thereof. Which you are notably occaſioned to doe, when in the adminiſtration of this Sacrament you firſt ſee the bread broken and the wine powred forth, and both particularly offered vnto euerie one of you, ſeuered and apart the one after the other, yet bearing the names of his bodie broken, and bloode ſhed for you. Secondly, knowing the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of bread and wine as you doe, and to what vſe they ſetue touching this life; they bearing heere the names of the bodie bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and blood ſhed of Chriſt as they doe, we aſſure you that thereby moſt iuſtlie we are occaſioned to beleue, that in the bodie broken and blood ſhed of Chriſt, both
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:2586:114"/>the breade and drinke, that is, all the foode that is neceſſary for the maintenance of our ſpirituall life for euer before God, lieth; and that therfore there it is only to be ſought. And in that theſe further thus called and vſed, are giuen vnto euery one of you that come vnto the Lordes boarde, and you take them, thereby the Lord by vs his miniſters particularly offers his bodie broken and his blood ſhedde vnto cue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of you, to feede and nouriſh you to euerlaſting life: and you by taking of them in outward ſhew, anſwere both him and vs, that you doe moſt firmly and ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly euery one of you particularly beleue, that he will doe ſo indeede. Wherefore in any caſe when you ſtreach forth your hands and open your mouthes to take breade and wine, thus called, at our hands; take Chriſtes ſo calling of them to be a moſt follemne promiſe to his, to aſſure you that if indeede then you beleeue that his body was once broken for you, and his blood ſhedde for the remiſſion of your ſins, as the ſtory of his paſſion and this Sacrament, which is a viſible commemoration therof; ſhewe, that then vndoubtedly without all queſtion, you doe not, nor cannot more ceratinly by thoſe inſtrumentes of your
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:2586:114"/>bodies, take the breade and wine &amp; feede thereof then by this faith of yours, the very mouth of your ſoule in this caſe, you feede vpon his broken bodie and bloode ſhedde: But then I ſay once againe, faile not but when your hands and mouthes are occupied about the taking &amp; feeding vpon the outward elements, let this faith of yours, which is in ſteede of both to your ſoule, be feruently occupied in beleeuing that by the broken body &amp; bloodſhed of Chriſt Ieſus your ſaluation was &amp; is fully purchaſed. Theſe three vſes thus made &amp; ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the receite of this Sacrament; in that you finde by experience, &amp; knowe it to be moſt certaine, that by the force &amp; ordinary worke of nature, bread and wine receiued in, &amp; diſgeſted are conuerted to fit foode for our nature, &amp; ſo there growes an vnion betwixt our nature and them: ſo this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thus receiued is and ought to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, as a ſealed couenant of Chriſt Ieſus by the mightie working of his Spirite, to aſſure vs that he will finde the means moſt certainlye to vnite himſelfe vnto vs, to nouriſh and to feed vs ſo with himſelfe, that in him we ſhall growe to be perfect men in his houſe. And laſtly, as this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſerues firſt to theſe ends, &amp; ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:2586:115"/>to ſtrengthen our faith in Ieſus Chriſt crucified: ſo ſerues it alſo as a moſt notable meane, outwardly both before God and men, to make confeſſion of the ſame our faith by; to diſtinguiſh vs as by our recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſance from others that are not of that fayth; to prouoke vs continually to offer vnto God the ſacrifice of thankeſgiuing for this moſt ſweete ſacrifice of his ſonne heerein brought freſh ſtill to our remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, and ſo beleeued in and vpon; and to be a bond of loue and vnitie amongeſt all the receiuers thereof. For as <hi>Paule</hi> ſaith, <hi>We that are many are one bread and one bodie, becauſe we are all partakers of one bread.</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.17. So that by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite heereof as firſt, our vnion and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Chriſt is ſealed vnto vs; ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo is it the ſeale and bond of the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that the Saintes of God haue amongſt themſelues. Wherefore as it ſtraitely bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vs hauing receiued it, vnleſſe we would haue it appeare that we receiued it vnworthily, afterwardes to liue as they that liue in, and by Chriſt: ſo it bindeth vs alſo all that receiue, as members knit together in one bodie vnder one head to liue toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in perfect peace and vnity. Worthilie therefore, all theſe thinges conſidered, may
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:2586:115"/>we ſay of it as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> did in his time: <hi>O Sacramentum pietatis! ô ſignum vnitatis! ô vinculum charitatis!</hi> that is, O Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of pietie! O ſigne of vnitie! O bond of charitie! <hi>tract.</hi> 26. vpon <hi>Iohn.</hi>

<pb n="209" facs="tcp:2586:116"/>that in the olde Teſtament God was thus carefull to haue none vnfit ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Sacramentes thereof, we may be well aſſured that he hath as greate care for the Sacraments of the new. Our warra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to admit childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the other, is, that they be borne and deſcended of ſuch pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes as profeſſe faith in Chriſt; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to whome and their ſeede God hath made Couenant to be their God: and the other reaſons before alleadged to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe incourage vs withall to the ſame: but in that Saint <hi>Paule,</hi> as we heard already, woulde haue euery one before he eate of this bread, and drinke of this cup in this Sacrament, to trie, examine, and iudge himſelfe, we may plainely learne that none but ſuch as haue diſcretion and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ſo to doe, and ſo doe indeede, are fit to be admitted to this. Moſt chriſtianly therefore it is prouided that none ſhoulde preſume heere in England, to preſent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to the Lordes table, before notice thereof giuen to his miniſter, that he may try whether he can anſwer his Catethiſme; or otherwiſe if he know him to be out of charitie, or guiltie of any notorious crime, he may put him off, vntill he can anſwere it, and vntill he haue ſatisfied the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:2586:117"/>by the teſtifying of his repentance, and be reconciled vnto the partie whom he hath wronged. And not without great and vrgent cauſe is <hi>Chriſtoſtome</hi> ſo earneſt as we may read he was in his 83. Homilie v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon <hi>Mathew,</hi> to perſwade the miniſters of his time in no caſe willingly to admit any wicked perſon to this table, willing them that if they durſt not or coulde not keepe backe ſuch, to tell him: for he would die rather then he woulde admit eyther Conſull, Duke, or King for any feare, that he knew to be vnfit.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa dominica quibuſda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſumitur ad vitam, qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſdam ad exitium:</hi> that is, That the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof might of ſome from the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Lord be receiued to life, and of ſome to deſtruction. And moſt certaine is all this, howſoeuer ſome would darken all this cleare light, and wipe away all this cleare euidence, by ſaying that none elſe but the faithfull indeede can worthily eate the fleſh of Chriſt and drinke his bloode, which are the thinges of this Sacrament:
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:2586:124"/>but yet vnworthily they may. For though we read, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.27. of an vnworthy ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the bread and drinking of the cup, that maketh them guiltie of the bodie and bloode of the Lord, as we haue heard: yet we neuer reade nor ſhall in all the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, of an vnworthy eating of his bodie and drinking of his bloode. For if there had beene any ſuch, Chriſt neyther could nor would haue ſaid ſo ſimplie abſolutely and confidently as he hath, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 6.54. and as we haue alreadie heard he did, <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer eateth my fleſh, &amp; drinketh my blood, hath eternall life, and I will raiſe him vp at the laſt day.</hi> No no, it is not the taking or feeding therupon that can hurtany, but the not doing ſo, that bringeth the daunger; eſpecially then when yet we would make a ſhowe to doe both, and yet indeede doe nothing leſſe.
<note place="margin">Chriſt is fed on, both God and man.</note> But all this while I vrging the right commumcant in the vſe of this Sacrament, to ſeeke inwardly by faith to feede vpon the body broken and bloode ſhed of Chriſt Ieſus himſelfe when out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly he feedeth vpon bread and wine, I would not be ſo taken as though my mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning were to teach, that faith heere were to reach no further then to the vniting of Chriſtes bare bodie and bloode, and the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:2586:124"/>right communicant togither. For as he both in bodie and ſoule ſtandeth neede of him to be his Sauiour, ſo it is certaine, as Chriſt both God and man perfecte God and perfecte man in one perſon is the head and husband of his Church and the redeemer and Sauiour thereof: ſo here faith is to feed ſo vpon his body broken &amp; blood ſhed, as that withall it muſt ſtedfaſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue and beleeue that it was &amp; is the body and blood of ſuch an one as was and is both very God and man, and yet but one perſon. For thence it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth that the things done for vs by his broken bodie and blood ſhed, though in number and time wherein they were done they were finite, are in the ſight of the heauenly Father of infinite value and dignitie (as once I ſaid before) to worke our perfect redemption and ſaluation, that they were done by ſuch a man that had not onely a perfect bodie and ſoule of a man, and in them both was ſuch an one as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came vs to haue, that was ſeperate from ſinners, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.27. but alſo was and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth for euer a true &amp; euerlaſting God and therefore was able thus to dignifie the workes done for vs in his manhood. And to this end it is moſt heauenly and diuinely noted. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. that the force that the offring
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:2586:125"/>that Chriſt made of himſelfe vpon the croſſe for vs, <hi>to purge our conſciences from dead workes to ſerue the liuing God,</hi> commeth and riſeth from hence, that then by his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Spirit, he offered himſelfe without fault to God for vs. And though I am not ignorant that <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> to very good purpoſe in his 46. Homilie vpon <hi>Iohn,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting thoſe wordes of Chriſt, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 6.63. <hi>It is the ſpirit that quickneth, the fleſh profiteth nothing; the wordes that I ſpeake vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you are ſpirit and life:</hi> notes that they were ſpoken by Chriſt not to diſable his fleſh altogether from being profitable, becauſe ſo to thinke is abſurd; but to warne vs that carnally we vnderſtand not his wordes, which by his interpretation there we doe if we take his wordes ſimplie as they ſound &amp; thinke no otherwiſe of them: for that as he ſaith, all miſteries are to be conſidered with inward eies, that is, ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually: yet I cannot but thinke with others alſo, that in ſo ſaying Chriſt meante not onely to teach vs that his wordes were not groſly and camally to betaken, that he had ſpoken of the eating of his fleſh and drinking of his bloode, (as the <hi>Capernaits</hi> and ſuch of his hearers that beleeued not, then tooke them) but ſpiritually (as his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:2586:125"/>diſciples, who notwithſtanding them, taried with him when the other mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured or departed by occaſion thereof) but that therin he had this further meaning and purpoſe to ſhew them that if his fleſh and blood were as they tooke them but the fleſh and bloode of a man, then they could not be indeed ſuch foode for their ſoules, as he had taught them to be; but beeing, as they were, the fleſh and blood of ſuch an one as withall was a ſpirit, and that an eternall creating Spirit euen very God, thence they might be ſure that they, rightly fed on by faith and the ſpirite, both could and would bring life. Thus there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we teach and exhort all men in the vſe of this Sacrament, to feede vpon the bodie broken and blood ſhed of our Chriſt and Sauiour. And yet thus we ſpeake with Chriſt, and according to the phraſe vſed in the inſtitution therof; becauſe as by Chriſt God and man, as by our onely me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour we come to the Father; ſo it hath pleaſed God in his word to reueale him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, that by his manhood and the workes done therin, we ſhould grow on to faith in his Godhead vnited thereunto and ſo ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning &amp; manifeſting it ſelfe vnto vs therin.</p>
            <p>Thus then I hope by this time, euen by
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:2586:126"/>this plaine and ſhort declaration onely of our faith and iudgement concerning the doctrine and nature of this Sacrament,
<note place="margin">The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of this our doctrine.</note> you may moſt clearely ſee and perceiue that we are wonderfully wronged and ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and that ſo alſo are all the Churches of our profeſſion, by our aduerſaries; whiles to diſcredit vs withal, they would make men belecue that we make it but a naked Supper of bread and wine, and ſo ſeeke to feede our people therein but with bare ſignes and figures. For you may ſee and heare that moſt plainely and earneſtly we vrge our hearers therein to ſeeke to feed to their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall ſaluation, of Chriſt Ieſus himſelfe both God and man: and ſo many other no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table vſes thereof as you heare we teach, that euen in reſpect thereof all the names and titles that any ſound antiquitie hath honoured this Sacrament withal, may moſt iuſtly be giuen vnto it as it is miniſtred and vſed by vs. We finde it hath beene cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Supper of the Lord, the Table of the Lord, the Sacrament of his bodie and bloode, the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> a Sacrifice, and <hi>Synaxis,</hi> and vſually with vs it is called the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And which of theſe is it not with vs? It is the ſupper of the Lord becauſe as we teach, at the laſt ſupper he inſtuted it and
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:2586:126"/>it is his Table becauſe therin he feedeth his with himſelf: it is the Sacrament of his body &amp; blood, becauſe to his it is a ſacred meanes of the Lord to nouriſh, ſtrengthen, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe their faith therein: it is the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> becauſe thereby we are ſo directly &amp; force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably occaſioned as we are, to yeeld all hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie thankes vnto God for the death and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Chriſt leſus, whereof it is ſo nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a memorial; and a Sacrifice euen ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alſo it may be tearmed: &amp; alſo <hi>Synax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is</hi> it is, becauſe it is an excellent bond of our aſſemblies and meetings together to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it and laſtly, worthily we may and doe call it the Communion, be cauſe it is a ſeale firſt of our communion with Chriſt, and then of one of vs with an other in him. And yet for all this, though this moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely be the generall doctrine held with one conſent by all the Churches that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe the Goſpell with vs; except of a fewe peeuiſh and wilfull <hi>Lutherans</hi> our aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, nor theſe neither will not be ſatisfied, but when we haue ſaid and done what we can, all is nothing with them that in this caſe we ſay or doe, vnleſſe we will with them by vertue of Chriſtes wordes ſpoken by him in the inſtitution heere of, hold ſuch a real preſence of Chriſtes bodie and blood

Which beeing a doctrine ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contrarie to that which lutherto I haue taught you rouching our vnion and communion with Chriſt by faith and his ſpirit onely, eſpecially, ſeeing alſo it is to be feared that a number haue bene ſo nouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led therein that the conceite they haue yet of the trueth thereof will hinder them, if it be not the better confuted, from taking any great good by al I haue ſaid hitherto: though otherwiſe heere I might well haue ended this matter and would, yet I muſt craue leaue of you to take ſome further paines for the better backing of that which I haue ſaid, to lay before you that which I thinke ſufficient for the iuſt confutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this groſſe moutheating of Chriſt Ieſus by all communicantes whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer.

            </p>
            <p>Heerein I ſhall haue to deale with two ſortes of aduerſaries: the one ſort where of are the <hi>Lutherans</hi> which I late ſpok of, who to that end interprete Chriſtes words ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the bread and wine, ſo, as that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon they inferre ſuch a Conſubſtantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:2586:127"/>that is, ſuch a beeing together of the verie bodie and blood of Chriſt with bread and wine in the vſe of this Sacrament, that whoſoeuerreceiues the one with his mouth, receiues the other: and the other ſort are our common aduerſaries the Papiſtes, who interprete the wordes of Chriſt ſo, as that by the force thereof they teach the bread and wine to be tranſubſtantiated, that is, to be turned into the bodie and bloode of Chriſt, as ſome of them haue held; or at leaſt thereby, as now moſt of them hold, ſo to be conueyed away that there remaines nothing but the accidents thereof, vnder which and together with which the bodie and bloode of Chriſt really are ſo certainly preſent, that euery receiuer thereof takes into his mouth the verie bodie and bloode of Chriſt. Otherwiſe theſe two are at dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly warre one with another, and the former in moſt of the groundes and principles of Chriſtian Religion hold with vs foundly againſt the other, and yet in this and for the maintenance of this their carnall and groſſe preſence, they are as vehement and bitter againſt vs for the denying &amp; oppug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thereof, as the other. Orderly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore todeale with them both, whereas there are ſome thinges in this caſe common to
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:2586:128"/>them both, wherein they both holde alike againſt vs; ſet vs conſider of them &amp; of the groundes thereof firſt, and afterwardes we will take a viewe of thoſe thinges and of their groundes alſo wherein they differ both betwixt themſelues and alſo from vs: leaſt otherwiſe we ſhould be driuen tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to repeate one thing often. By their bookes that they haue written &amp; daily doe about this matter, it is cuident that they both holde a reall preſence of Chriſtes bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and blood together with the outward elements in the vſe of this Sacrament: and likewiſe, that they both therfore teach, that together with the ſame euery receiuer, haue he a right faith or no, receiues in by his mouth the verie real &amp; true bodie &amp; blood of Chriſt. And both of them ground both theſe their opinions, firſt of Chriſtes words vttered of the bread and wine; then of his almightineſſe: and laſtly of the ſtate now of his glorified bodie. In and about the outward elements when they come to be taken of the mouth of the receiuer, what they be and how long this their reall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of bodie and blood with them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues, they could neuer yet agree. For the maintainers of Conſubſtantiation plainely with vs, notwithſtanding Chriſtes wordes
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:2586:128"/>and all their other grounds for their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his reall preſence, holde and teach that they remaine ſubſtantially bread and wine ſtill, and ſo are taken and eaten: and the other will haue after thoſe wordes are once pronounced, the ſubſtances of breade and wine to be gone quite, (though vnto this day they coulde neuer agree to tell what was become of them) and the onely accidentes thereof to ſupplie the roome al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies after of the outward part of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. The other hold their reall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence continueth no longer, or at leaſt is tyed no longer to bread and wine, nor to any more of it then is receiued, and the miniſterie thereof laſteth. For <hi>Extra vſum,</hi> (as they ſpeake) that is, beſides the vſe, they hold neither the bread nor the wine that remaines, to be the bodie and bloode of Chriſt: whereas the other ſtiflie main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that all the hoſtes that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate are euery one of them the bodie of Chriſt, and therefore they hang them vp, which they leaue, in a Pixe vnder a Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie and honour and worſhip them as the verie bodies of their Sauiour. And for the wine they take careful order for that, bicauſe they cannot tell howe ſo well to preſerue and keepe that belike ſweete as the other;
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:2586:129"/>to conſecrate no more then their prieſt may quite and cleane ſup vp at that verie time. But to let theſe their diſagreeings alone, the things wherein they agree herein are nowe to be conſidered of: wherein, their manner of reall preſence of Chriſt offers it ſelfe firſt. Touching the which to begin withall, this I dare be bolde to ſay, for I knowe it to be moſt true how drunken ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer they be with a conceit to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; it is contrarie to all doctrine taught vs in the Scriptures, or in any ancient Father or Councell for ſix hundred yeeres after Chriſt at the leaſt. For with one conſent all theſe when they ſpeake of Chriſtes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in this Sacrament, it is reall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence to the beleeuing communicant, for whom indeed he gaue his bodie and blood, that they ſpeake for, and that they ſpeake of: as for any ſuch reall prefence of his, eyther with or vnder bread and wine or vnder the accidentes thereof, as theſe men now plead for, neuer eyther any writer of any of the Canonical Scriptures, nor any ſound Father or Councel euer once drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med off. And this reall &amp; true preſence of Chriſt to the right receiuer we do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, but we vrge &amp; teach more plainlie and comfortablie than anic of them doc. And
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:2586:129"/>this is it that bringeth inſeperablie with it eternal life &amp; ſaluation in Chriſt; &amp; as for this of theirs, the verie force of trueth &amp; flat experience haue driuen them to confeſſe may be, and yet the receiuer thereby ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the better but the worſe. What a vaine thing then is it for men to keepe ſuch a ſturre to the vexing and diſturbing of all Chriſtendome for a thing ſo fruitleſſe? Alas who is ſo ſimple but that he knoweth or may ſoone knowe that Chriſtes bodie was broken and his bloode ſhed for vs men, and not for breade and wine; and therefore that neyther bread nor wine, are the thinges that haue to doe with his preſence nor yet their accidents, but onely we men: and then that we may haue it ſufficiently to our ſaluation, who ſeeth not that it is the vaineſt thing in the world to ſtriue for it, for bread and wine and their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentes? Further, ſeeing both of theſe doe confeſſe this to be a Sacrament wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we now intreate, &amp; neither of them yet could ſhew or euer went about it, that in any other Sacrament either of the olde or new Teſtament there was euer any ſuch real coniunction of the inward and ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al part thereof with the outward, and yet al men know for all that, they were and are
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:2586:130"/>effectuall Sacramentes and ſeales of the deliuerie thereof to the right receiuer; what reaſon in the world can they haue why they ſhould not thinke that this likewiſe may be and alſo is a full and effectuall Sacrament to participate the bodie and bloode of Chriſt without any ſuch coupling of them and the outward elements therof, as for the defence of this their real preſence here they vrge? If that were heere neceſſarie, it ſhould be ſo eyther by the generall right of all Sacramentes, or by ſome ſpeciall right that may be ſhewed this hath therunto. But neither of theſe can they or ſhall they euer be able indeed to ſhew in this caſe. Further Chriſts owne ſitting viſibly ſeuered in place without any altering of his forme, or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of his place hauing vttered the words of the inſtitution, they being doubtleſſe as powrefull then as euer they were ſince or ſhalbe, to make him really to be preſent to and with the outward elements, doth moſt clearely ouerthrow this conceite. And for the next of hauing him ſo really heerewith preſent and conioyned that the receiuers thereof though they haue neyther faith nor good manners, yet receiue him alſo ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, as I haue alreadie ſufficiently proued, it is both againſt Scripture and ſound an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie:
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:2586:130"/>and the former beeing ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, whereupon it followeth and is built, as I haue nowe ſhewed it is, that muſt alſo therewith fall downe and be ouerthrowne. Yet for the further mabling of thee (wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beloued) to ſee yet more not onely the vanitie and impietie thereof, vnderſtand that ſuch a kinde of preſence of Chriſt ſhakes all the articles touching the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of Chriſt, and in verie deed leades men moſt ſtrongly ſo to ſpoyle him of all the true properties of his manhood, that in effect it leadeth them and moſt forceably teacheth them to denie him indeede to be come into the fleſh, and to be the ſeede of the woman, of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> of <hi>Iuda, Ieſſe,</hi> and <hi>Dauid,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ancient propheſies that are of the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> And ſo for a bootleſſe eating of him and fruitleſſe, as they themſelues muſt needes confeſſe this mouth-eating of him to be, (for that they graunt, ouen to the worſt ſort of men that receiue the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward elements,) in the end they will leaue vs no true Chriſt at all, eyther for vnbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers or beleeuers to feede vpon. I knowe their refuge and ſhift is to auoide this withall, to ſay that it is by miracle as they teach, and yet Chriſtes manhood and all
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:2586:131"/>the articles touching the ſame, true, ſound, and whole. Indeede any man may ſee that eyther they muſt ſay ſo, or elſe they can ſay nothing: and that in trueth and of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſſitie it muſt be graunted to be the greateſt miracle that euer was wrought, if it be as they ſay, and yet all theſe things be vpheld ſound according to the true &amp; ancient catholicke faith. For of both theſe it muſt needs follow that Chriſt at one and ſelfe ſame time hath a bodie viſible and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſible, palpable and impalpable, compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in place and vncompaſſed; yea that he hath but one bodie, and yet many bodies, or that one multiplied into many; vnleſſe contrary to manifeſt Scripture they wilde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie him in the heauens (<hi>Which ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine him,</hi> as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>vntill the reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of al thinges. Act.</hi> 3.21.) to haue, though a glorified bodie yet a true bodie; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie whereof all the ancient Fathers, as they know well enough, with vs againſt them haue taught. And they know though ſundrie of theſe Fathers of purpoſe haue written of the miracles of the Scripture, that yet they haue not once reckoned vp this of theirs amongſt them. Neither haue they any reaſon why to thinke that there is heere any ſuch. A myſterie and great my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:2586:131"/>we willingly acknowledg it to be, that in the right vſe of this Sacrament, Chriſt by his Spirit by the meanes of the faith of his, verily vnites himſelf vnto his: but yet no mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle we count it, or cal it, becauſe it is Gods ordinary work in other Sacraments ſo to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate himſelfe to thoſe that rightly vſe them: and becauſe when he worketh a miracle there is ſome ſtraunge thing done beyond nature, that the verie ſenſes can iudge of; which we finde not heere. For they all with one conſent iudge them in reſpect of their ſubſtances, to be verie bread and wine ſtill in the mouthes of all receiuers. O but (ſay they) neyther ſenſe nor reaſon are to be conſulted withall in this caſe. Indeed I graunt they neuer are againſt any trueth certainely taught and warranted by the Scriptures; but when their iudgement concurres and conſents therewith, then it is verie lawfull and good to liſten thereunto: and ſo alwaies haue the godlie learned in all ages thought and taught. And therefore ſeeing both ſenſe and reaſon ſtriue againſt this their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe, for the maintenance of Chriſtes true manhoode, and the right ſenſe of all the articles of our faith touching the ſame with vs; euen thereby their cauſe
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:2586:132"/>hath a greater wound than they are euer able to cure againe. Beſides all this, whiles they thus teach without all warrant from Chriſt or hir word; they are compelled, leaſt otherwiſe they ſhoulde be inforced; moſt abſurdly to ſay that the wicked eate the bodie and blood of Chriſt to ſaluation; to ſeperate Chriſt and his ſauing graces the one from the other, whereas they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſeuered. For that muſt alwaies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine an abſolute trueth, <hi>Whoſoeuer eateth his fleſh and drinketh his bloode, hath eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life. Iohn.</hi> 6.54. and ſo that alſo, <hi>he that hath the Sonne hath life, and he that hath not the ſonne hath not life. Iohn.</hi> 5.12: A ſpirituall vnion and communion with him they ſhall both finde oft promiſed and ſpoken of, as I haue at large alreadie ſhewed: but a beeing of his bodie and bloode in the verie mouthes of all recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers as they talke of, otherwiſe then Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally, that is, when the outward ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes or ſignes therof are there, they ſhall neuer finde ſo much as once ſpoken for in the ſcriptures, or in any ſound and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient writer indeed. I cannot denie but that indeed the <hi>Capernaits, Iohn.</hi> 6. by miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceiuing of Chriſtes ſpeeches there had of the eating of his fleſh and drinking of
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:2586:132"/>his blood, began to dreame that he meant ſome ſuch thing: but we haue heard that <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> plainely ſheweth by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere that he made them, that he had no ſuch meaning; his wordes were ſpiritually to be vnderſtood, and ſo ſhould giuelife and not otherwiſe. And <hi>Athanaſius</hi> vpon theſe wordes, <hi>Whoſoeuer ſpeaketh a worde againſt the Sonne of man,</hi> writeth that withall then Chriſt put them in minde of his aſcenſion, as indeed he did <hi>Iohn.</hi> 6.62. to draw them from corporall and fleſhly vnderſtanding of his wordes. And therefore verie excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently hath <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> to preuent all ſuch conceits or murmuring, by occaſion of that doctrine of Chriſt, written of thoſe words of his whereat they ſo ſtumbled; in his third booke of chriſtian doctrine, <hi>Chap.</hi> 16. ſaying thus, That ſaying of Chriſt, <hi>except ye eate the fleſh of the Sonne of man &amp; drinke his bloode, ye haue no life, &amp;c.</hi> ſeemeth to commend an heinous thing and a wicked: and therefore it is a figure commaunding vs to be partakers of Chriſtes paſſion, and to keepe in our mindes to our great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and profit that his fleſh was crucified and wounded for vs. But I am not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant that theſe men would ſeeme to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the <hi>Capernaits</hi> opinion as much as we;
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:2586:133"/>and that therefore they labour to put an infinite difference betwixt their fanſie of eating his fleſh and drinking his bloode, and this of theirs. For they imagined (ſay they) that then they ſhould feede vpon them viſiblie, and by piece-meale as they did of other their vſuall meat and drinke: whereas they purpoſe them to be fed on inuiſibly and wholly. But alas what a poore difference is this, as though it were not as much againſt the lawe of God the law of all nations and nature al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, knowing it, to eate and drinke mans fleſh and bloode vnſeene as ſeene, all at a morſell or at a ſup, as by many morſels and ſuppes? If yet they will needes vrge this their reall preſence and their mouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eating really of Chriſt, how will they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyde the daunger then, that that generall and vniuerſall propoſition of Chriſt will bringe them vnto, ſaying as we reade he did <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.17: <hi>What ſoeuer entreth into the mouth goeth into the bellie, &amp; is caſt out into the draught, &amp;c?</hi> Euen this hath cauſed many both as learned as any of them and farre more ancient, to vnderſtand the eating of Chriſt to be by the mouth of the ſoule, faith; and not by the very mouth of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die. And they know, with one conſent the
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:2586:133"/>ancient Fathers teach that the wicked and vnbeleeuing whiles they remain ſuch, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eate the bodie and bloode of Chriſt: which they neither could nor would haue done, if they had knowne that there was any ſuch reall preſence, eyther by Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation or Conſubſtantiation, as nowe theſe men teach. For eyther of theſe beeing graunted, the other how abſurd ſoeuer it be muſt follow thereupon. And therefore is it, becauſe they know that the Conſequent being abſurd the Antecedent fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence it floweth muſt needs be ſo alſo, that theſe men are thus eager to defend this to be no abſurditie, that all that communicate, though they be neuer ſo bad and faithleſſe, eate the bodie and drinke the bloode of Chriſt really: for otherwiſe they know they cannot defend any longer their reall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence as they do. For Iſee no cauſe elſe why they ſhould make ſo much a doe for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſo vnworthie to haue ſuch care and paines taken for them.</p>
            <p>But yet ſo wedded are theſe men vnto their groundes that they haue builded this their fancie vpon mentioned before,
<note place="margin">Chriſtes wordes proue not their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</note> that vnleſſe we can driue them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all yet ſaid againſt it, it is to be feared that they wil think that they both
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:2586:134"/>may and ought to holde it ſtill. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, whereas firſt they ſeeme to thinke that the wordes of Chriſt are plaine and preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to prooue their kind of reall preſence, and mouth-eating conſequently of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and bloode; doubtleſſe if with a ſingle eie and without any preiudicate opinion we conſider thereof, we ſhall ſoone ſee that it is nothing but peeuiſhneſſe &amp; wilfulneſſe that makes them eyther ſo to ſay or thinke. That the wordes of Chriſt are moſt certaine and true in the ſenſe that he meant them when he vttered them, we neuer denied nor will; no nor yet we neuer gaue leaue vnto our ſelues ſo much as once to doubt thereof. Wherefore if any of them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade any man otherwiſe of vs, they doe vs open and manifeſt wrong. Neither can we thinke ſo vncharitablie of them, but that we are perſwaded that they ſo likewiſe thinke of them. Heerein then is the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and controuerſie betwixt them and vs, whether we or they hit of the right ſenſe thereof. Which beeing the queſtion indeed as it is; for the determining herof euery rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable man muſt needes confeſſe, that whoſe interpretation agrees beſt with the nature of the thing in hand, with the ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie of faith and good manners, with the
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:2586:134"/>reſt of the Scriptures and ſound antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that is to be taken beſt to agree with Chriſtes meaning, and therefore is the fenſe to be followed and preferred before all others. Nowe we interprete the wordes of Chriſt as ſpoken by a <hi>Metonymie,</hi> that is, by a figure of ſpeech whereby one thing beares the name of the other; as heere bread and wine we ſay doe, of the bodie broken and blood ſhed of Chriſt; becauſe the one both ſignifies and repreſentes the other vnto vs, and alſo aſſures vs rightlie receiuing the one, that we are and ſhalbe partakers alſo of the other. Theſe men crie and vrge that the wordes are plaine and without any ſuch figure, and yet how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer they therefore agree that they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port a reall preſence to the outward cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, and to the mouth of euerie recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer (as we haue heard;) yet the one ſorte would haue them expounded to that end to inferre Conſubſtantiation, and the other a Tranſubſtantiation. Iudge therefore now I beſeech you by the foreſaid rules, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theirs or ours be likeſt to be Chriſtes meaning. The matter in hande, when thoſe wordes were firſt vttered by him, was a Sacrament: and they know as wel as we, that in all other Sacramentes when
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:2586:135"/>eyther they were inſtituted by God, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſpoken of by him; though the very like Phraſes for all the world were v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of them, that are here by Chriſt of theſe: that yet vnto this day neuer any of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues or others expounded them eyther as they doe theſe heere, or otherwiſe then we doe theſe. Circumciſion is called the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.10. the Lamb the Paſſeouer, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.21. the rocke that the people of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael dranke the water of in the wilderneſſe Chriſt. 1. <hi>Cor</hi> 10.4. the blood of their ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, the blood of the Couenant, <hi>Exod.</hi> 24.8. the Arke, the King of glorie and <hi>Iehouah. Pſal.</hi> 24.8.10. and Baptiſme is called the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer or waſhing of our new birth, Tit. 3.5. And yet who euer expounded theſe phraſes eyther by Tranſubſtantiation or Conſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation, thereby really to make alwaies preſent to euery of theſe outward elements the ſpirituall matter thereby ſignified and reſembled? yea, who euer vnderſtoode theſe otherwiſe, then to be as the wordes import, onely by ſignification &amp; repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and for the aſſurance of the right vſers of them, of the preſence to them of the thinges therby ſignified and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented ſpiritually? Why therfore ſhould Chriſt either ſpeake otherwiſe in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting of this, then had beene vſed in
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:2586:135"/>all other Sacraments; or ſpeaking but euen ſo, what reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is there why his ſpeach ſhould otherwiſe be vnderſtood heere then in all the reſt? To ſay that this hath a ſpecial and eſſentiall difference from all other Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and therefore though theſe phraſes be ſo to be taken in all other, yet they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſo be in this: though when they ſay ſo they thinke they haue ſaid much to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, yet indeed they haue ſaid nothing. For who knoweth not that a man hath an eſſential difference to diſtinguiſh him from all other creatures vnder the ſame General that he is? And yet that letteth not but that whatſoeuer belongs to the nature of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to him with al the reſt? For elſe he ſhould not be defined by his Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. So if that which appertains to the nature of a Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in general, of which ſort this is that now we talk of, were not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this with the reſt, it could not with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be ſaid, to be a Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t as it is. If therfore the outward elements bearing the names of the inward graces, neither inforce or impart any ſuch thing in any of the other, no reaſon is there why it ſhould in this. And ſurely the diſciples beeing ſo well acquainted with ſuch kind of phraſes in al the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of the old Teſtament, therby were prepared quietly to heare Chriſt to vſe the like in this,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:2586:136"/>and readily &amp; rightly they vnderſtood him as in the other: &amp; therfore neuer once were offended or amaſed at his ſpeach, or made any queſtioning with him eyther then or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards about the ſenſe therof. Whereas if they had taken them in any ſuch ſenſe, and had thought that they did import any ſuch matter as eyther of theſe ſortes of men imagine they did; they beeing ſo bold with him at other times alwaies in matters of farre leſſe importance and difficulty as to inquire his meaning, they woulde alſo doubtleſſe ſo haue done in this. Which thing in ſome ſort, and that with ſome fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matter verie fit to croſſe theſe mens conceit, <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> in his 83. Homilie vpon <hi>Mathew</hi> hath noted ſaying, euen ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the wordes of the inſtitution now in queſtion: <hi>Quomodo non turbati erant, cum hoc audiſſent? quia multa &amp; magna de hoc antea diſſeruit, &amp;c.</hi> that is, <hi>how came it to paſſe that they were not troubled</hi> (meaning his diſciples) <hi>when they heard this? becauſe many &amp; weightie things he had diſcourſed of this before vnto them.</hi> And a little after he noteth, that he himſelfe drunke thereof, leaſt hearing thoſe wordes they ſhoulde haue ſaid; what then doe we drinke blood and eate his fleſh? and therefore ſhoulde
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:2586:136"/>haue beene troubled. For when he firſt ſpoke hereof (ſaith he) many were offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded onely for his wordes: leaſt therefore heereby that alſo now ſhould haue chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, he did this firſt himſelf that ſo he might with a quiet minde induce them to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of theſe myſteries. Now as for the ſecond rule to examine our expoſition of theſe wordes by, that which I haue ſaid alreadie is both ſufficient to iuſtifie ours, and to condemne theirs. For in nothing ours can be ſaid to be contrarie, or but to carie any ſhew of contrarietie eyther to the doctrine of good manners or to the analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie of faith (if you ſhoulde examine from point to point our iudgement hereof and of the nature and vſe of the whole Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as I haue expreſſed it;) and theirs, as I lately ſhewed in the confutation of their reall preſence, both in ſhewe and in trueth moſt directly croſſeth &amp; contrarieth both. For hath not euen nature a loathing to the taking in by mouth and ſo ſwallowing of a whole man, fleſh, bloode, and bones at one morſell? And a man that can be ſo taken in and eaten of ſo many communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantes as be in worlde at one time, who can be perſwaded that he hath the true nature indeed of a man? And come to the third,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:2586:137"/>that is, by the Scriptures themſelues to trie this matter by, and quickly we ſhal find by them our expoſition warranted, and this of theirs and the conſequents thereof confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. For firſt, whereas they would counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance theirs againſt ours, by ſaying that Chriſtes words are plaine &amp; without figure; looke but a little vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and you ſhalbe inforced to confeſſe, &amp; ſo they alſo wil they nil they, that he hath vſed in the inſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this Sacrament, in his words ſundry figures. For firſt he ſaith of the one that it was his body giuen for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith, or broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for them, as <hi>Paule</hi> ſpeaketh: &amp; then of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that it was his blood ſhed for them, as <hi>Mathew, Marke</hi> &amp; <hi>Luke</hi> report his words; ſo ſpeaking of that which yet then was not done, as it is wel known, as though the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it had bene done, by an vſual figure in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, vſing the time paſt or preſent for the time to come. Againe concerning the latter eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, <hi>Mathew</hi> ſaith that he ſaid it was his blood of the new Teſtament, and ſo doth <hi>Mark: Luke</hi> ſets down his words thus, <hi>This cup is the new Teſtament in my bloode;</hi> &amp; ſo alſo doth <hi>Paule:</hi> wherin &amp; wherby any man may ſee, that wilfully will not make himſelf blind, two figuratiue kind of ſpeeches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſids this that we ſtriue for. For here is the cup
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:2586:137"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taining, put for that which was therin co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained: &amp; whatſoeuer they would haue that to be, wine or his very blood; I am ſure they neither yet can or wil ſay that either the one or the other is the new Teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t it ſelfe. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then it might ſtand with the nature of this Sacrament &amp; Chriſts care &amp; deſire to be therin vnderſtood to vſe the figurs; what letteth but that we may as lawfully thinke that he vſed the vſual <hi>Metonymie</hi> vſed in all other Sacraments, in giuing the names of body &amp; blood to bread &amp; wine, that were but repreſentatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s &amp; ſeales of our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion with his body &amp; blood, to our euerlaſting nouriſhment? This variety in theſe, in repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting &amp; ſetting down the words of the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution as may be ſene by this that I haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready noted, argues that they were not ſo ſuperſtitiouſly tied to a ſet ſort &amp; number of words as theſe men imagine: yea that they, ſo they kept his very ſenſe, thought that it was lawful for them thus to ad or change a word or two tending onely to explaine the ſame, hereby it is euident. For <hi>Pauls</hi> word Broken in ſteed of <hi>Lukes</hi> Giuen, ſhews how his body ſhould be giuen euen to be broken with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, with whippings, crowning with thorn &amp; nailing as it was to the croſſe: &amp; theſe two added by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, not vſed by <hi>Mat.</hi> or <hi>Mar.</hi> ſerue
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:2586:138"/>to ſhew vs what bodie of his it is, I meane in reſpect of what ſtate thereof it is, that heere by this Sacrament we are occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to thinke vpon it, and to feede on it: and by the other chaunge of their phraſe, for Blood of the new Teſtament, ſaying, it was the newe Teſtament in his bloode, moſt plainly we are taught, that therefore called heit the blood of the new Teſtament becauſe the new Teſtament was ratified and ſo ſtandeth by the ſhedding of that bloode to all beleeuers in him. But indeed though they would ſeeme to be men that make wonderfull great conſcience of the letter and wordes, as though it were ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to goe one iot from the ſound there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: yet any man that lookes but with halfe an eye vpon either of their interpretations which they ſtand vpon to grounde their kinde of reall preſence by, ſhall ſoone per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that they are nothing the men they make ſhewe for. For is it all one eyther to ſay, together with this is my bodie and bloode, or vnder the accidentes heereof is my bodie and blood, and to ſay This is my bodie and bloode? And yet thus, when al is done, Chriſtes wordes muſt ſounde or elſe neither will there or can there be either the <hi>Lutherans</hi> Conſubſtantiation, or the
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:2586:138"/>popiſh Tranſubſtantiation brought in ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to vphold their fond reall preſence by. Sure I am neyther any Dictionarie or Grammer in the worlde will allow them thus to expounde this worde <hi>Is.</hi> Were it not better for them with vs to retaine the word, and alſo with vs ſo to expound it or vnderſtand it as not onelie vſually alwaies it is in all other Sacramentall phraſes, but alſo commonly alwaies when it is placed betweene two thinges of ſo diuers natures as bread and wine, and bodie and bloode be? The rather yet to prouoke them ſo to doe, let them but conſider whether their newe found ſenſe therof, or this of ours vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding it as placed for (it ſignifieth repreſenteth and ſealeth vnto you my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die broken and blood ſhed to be yours to eternall life) ſtand better but with theſe wordes of Chriſt, <hi>Doe this in remembrance of me. Luke</hi> 22.19. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.24. eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſo taken as it is cleare <hi>Paule</hi> tooke them, when thereof he inferreth, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. <hi>as oft as ye ſhall eate this bread and drinke this cup, ye ſhew the Lords death till he come?</hi> For according to our doctrine, by theſe words thus vnderſtood Chriſt would teach vs that this Sacrament was inſtituted by him of purpoſe to keepe in our memories his death
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:2586:139"/>and paſſion, and by the vſe whereof wee might, vntill his comming againe to iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, profeſſe and nouriſh our faith in his body then broken and blood ſhed for vs. Here is nothing ſounding in the meane time towardes any corporall preſence of his to the outward elements or mouthes of the receiuers whoſoeuer: but theſe words <hi>In remembrance of me,</hi> and <hi>Till he come againe</hi> ſounde plainly to the cotrarie. For what need a thing to be done in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of one bodily preſent; or how can a thing with any good ſence be ſaid to be done but till one come, that yet he being verily preſent in body is done? We read <hi>Act.</hi> 1.11. that ſhortly after the inſtitution of this Sacrament he viſibly aſcended into heauen, the Apoſtles ſeing him ſo to doe with their eyes: and there we read alſo that the Angels told them, that even ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he ſhoulde come againe when he comes from thence: reading alſo as we doe and haue alreadie noted once or twiſe, <hi>that the heauens muſt containe him vntill the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of all things. Act.</hi> 3.21. and that his comming from thence is plainely cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his ſecond co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.28. how can we but thinke that Chriſt as well meant to
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:2586:139"/>forwarne vs of theſe fellowes, that by their Conſubſtantiation or Tranſubſtantiation ſay vnto vs, lo heere is Chriſt with this piece of bread, or vnder the accidents therof, loe take him into thy verie mouth: as of thoſe that point vnto vs wrong Chriſtes heere or there, when he ſaid, if any ſhould ſay vnto you (ſpeaking of ſuch as ſhould ſo doe after he had left the world, &amp; was gone vnto his Father) <hi>Loe heere is Chriſt, or there is Chriſt, beleeue him not?</hi> And how is it poſſible that we ſhould beleeue theſe places of Scripture to be true, and hold ſtil them notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that Chriſt is really and in his full bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die preſent in euery communicants mouth? May we thinke with <hi>Peter,</hi> that the heauens doe and ſhall containe him ſtill, and that yet vpon this occaſion he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies thus heere? And that beeing ſo, how can it be that his comming from thence at the laſt daie, ſhall be but his ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, or that it is true when he comes from thence he ſhall come viſibly, no ſuch thing hauing euer beene ſeene heere. I knowe they will ſay, all theſe places are to be vnderſtood of his viſible body, and that they ſpeake of his inuiſible bodie. Yea but then we replie, where euer learned they
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:2586:140"/>either in Scripture, or in any ancient Father, that euer he had any ſuch inuiſible bodie: or howe can they euer make it ſinke into any mans head that hath rightlie learned in the Scriptures to know Chriſtes manhood, that at one and ſelfe ſame time he ſhoulde haue a viſible bodie and an inuiſible, yea one in the heauens to come inuiſiblie againe when he pleaſeth; and yet the ſame both there and this heere alſo multiplied into ſo many inuiſible bodies as there be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers mouthes? If this be not with the olde rotten doting and long agoe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned <hi>Marcion</hi> to make a meere phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſme of the bodie of Chriſt, let any man iudge. But once for all by this ſworde of the Spirit, to pierce this monſtrous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt of theirs to the verie heart and ſo to leaue it for dead: ſeeing they ſtande ſo much vpon the letter and wordes of the text, I would haue them once againe to marke and remember that Saint <hi>Paule,</hi> that ſaith therein <hi>That which he receiued of the Lord he deliuered,</hi> hath vpon his credite told vs that the Lord ſpeaking of the bread called it not ſimplie and nakedly his bodie, but his bodie broken; and they all agree in one that he called the other his blood ſhed. If therefore they will ſticke
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:2586:140"/>to the wordes of the text, and yet haue a reall preſence as they teach, of his verie bodie and blood by vertue of the wordes thereof; they ſee moſt plainely then it muſt be of his bodie broken and of his blood ſhed. Vnleſſe therefore nowe they can finde vs an inuiſible bodie broken and blood inuiſible ſhed of his, for the mouth of euerie receiuer, they neither ſay or doe any thing to the purpoſe according to the text. But I hope they are not ſo farre gone, but they know that it is now a thouſand and fiue hundred yeares agoe and more, ſince he had eyther his bodie broken or blood ſhed; and that when they were ſo, he died ſo that he dies no more, as we reade. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.9. And therefore e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen heereby the moſt ſimple may ſee that though they could ſhew that his bodie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue or glorified could be inuiſible, infinite, and ſo multipliable as their doctrine im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portes, which yet they can neuer doe; that yet all this were nothing to the reall preſence of the bodie and blood of Chriſt in reſpect of that eſtate of his, when the one was broken, and the other ſhed for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of our ſinnes. And yet heereby it is moſt euident that the bodie and bloode of Chriſt, in reſpect of this their eſtate
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:2586:141"/>and condition, are the bodie and blood of his, that expreſly by the words of the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution we are heere to ſeeke for and to feede vpon. How can this then be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe but as we teach, by calling heereby to our remembrance, that once moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely they were thus handled for vs; and by beleeuing that therby our ſaluation was wrought: which as oft as we doe, we are fed and nouriſhed therewith to eternall life. Thus then you ſee, the matter in hand, the Analogie of faith and good manners, and not onely other Scriptures, but the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie words of the inſtitution lead ſtrongly to the maintena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of our expoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Chriſts words in the inſtitution of this Sacrament, and to the vtter ouerthrow of theirs. And truely the ancient Fathers, as we haue a thouſand times ſhewed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, are wholly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of our ſide, againſt them. It were infinite to bring al that might be found in them to this purpoſe, as by large volumes written and publiſhed by vs about this matter we haue made it euident. Howbeit, ſomwhat yet now againe let vs heare what ſome of the chiefe of them haue ſaid. Chriſt tooke bread which comforteth mans heart, that he might therby repreſent the trueth of his body, ſaith <hi>Hierome</hi> vpon the 26. of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew.</hi>
               <pb n="259" facs="tcp:2586:141"/>Chriſt in his laſt ſupper, (ſaith <hi>Cyprian</hi> in his ſermon <hi>de vnctione Chriſmatis</hi>) with his owne hands, at his table, gaue his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles bread &amp; wine; but vpon the croſſe, he gaue his body to be wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded by the hands of the ſouldiers, that ſincere trueth more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly imprinted in the Apoſtles, &amp; the true ſincerity might expound vnto the nations, how bread &amp; wine was the body &amp; blood, and after what ſort the cauſes and their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects agreed, and diuers names and kindes ſhould be reduced to one eſſence, and the things ſignifying and the things ſignified were called with one &amp; ſelfe ſame names. And <hi>Ambroſe</hi> in his 4. booke &amp; 4. chapter of Sacraments writeth; that as in Baptiſme we receiue the ſimilitude of death, ſo in this ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t we drink the ſimilitude of Chriſts blood. And <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> moſt plainly ſaith in his 11. Homily vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Mathew,</hi> that Chriſt his body it ſelfe is not in the holy veſſels, but the myſterie &amp; Sacrament therof. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> in his 57. queſtion vpon <hi>Leuiticus,</hi> preſcribeth for a rule, that the thing that ſignifieth is wont to beare the name of the thing which it ſingifieth, as <hi>Paule</hi> ſaid (ſaith he) the rock was Chriſt, &amp; not ti ſignified Chriſt, but eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as it had bene indeed; which neuertheleſſe, was not Chriſt by ſubſtance,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:2586:142"/>but by ſignification. And in his 23. Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle he ſaith, that the ſimilitude betwixt the ſigne and thing ſignified is the verie cauſe why the one beareth the name of the other in Sacramentes: and therefore in his third booke of Chriſtian doctrine he ſaith, it is a miſerable ſlauerie of the ſoule to take the ſignes for the thinges ſignified, <hi>Cap.</hi> 5. Chriſt honored the ſignes and repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which are ſeene, with the names of his bodie and blood, ſaith <hi>Theodoret</hi> in his ſecond dialogue. <hi>Gelaſius</hi> againſt <hi>Eutiches</hi> affirmeth the image &amp; ſimilitude of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and blood to be celebrated in theſe my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries. Bede vpon <hi>Luke.</hi> 22. writeth that becauſe bread doth comfort mans heart, and wine doth make good blood in his bodie; therefore the breade is myſtically compared to Chriſts bodie, and the wine to his blood. And who hath not heard vs an hundred times tell them, that <hi>Tertulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> in his fourth booke againſt <hi>Marcion,</hi> interpreteth This is my body, ſaying that it is to ſay, this is a figure of my bodie: and that likewiſe <hi>Auguſtine</hi> againſt <hi>Adimantus</hi> the <hi>Manichee</hi> writeth, that Chriſt doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not to ſay, This is my body when he gaue a ſigne of his bodie: and vpon the third Pſalme that he ſaith that Chriſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:2586:142"/>
               <hi>Iudas</hi> to a banquet, where he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended a figure of his bodie to his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples? And what can be plainer then theſe eyther againſt them, or for vs? All theſe thinges conſidered therefore, we may boldlie conclude that they haue no ground from Chriſtes wordes for their groſſe reall preſence.</p>
            <p>And ſurely as little haue they eyther from his omnipotencie,
<note place="margin">Neither his omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency, nor glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed body will helpe them.</note> or from the ſtate of his glorified bodie. For he will not ſhew his omnipotencie in whatſoeuer we liſt, but in effecting whatſoeuer himſelfe pleaſeth: and therefore they failing in the proofe as they haue, that it is his pleaſure to haue it as they would; it is in vaine for them to thinke that this can or will helpe them out. But indeed and trueth howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer they would ſeeme to grounde much vpon his almightineſſe, &amp; to haue a ſtrong faith therein, and ſeeke to diſcredit our faith in the ſame: yet in this verie point lot theirs and ours be but a little indifferentlie compared togither, and ours ſoone will prooue farre the ſtronger. For I woulde haue them tell me in good ſadneſſe whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Centurion <hi>Math.</hi> 8.8. that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed that he beleeued that though Chriſt came no nearer his houſe then he was in
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:2586:143"/>reſpect of his bodilie preſence, that yet he was perſwaded that if he but ſpake the word, his ſcruant ſhould be healed; or <hi>Iai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> that ſaid come and lay thy handes on my daughter, and ſhe ſhall liue, <hi>Math.</hi> 9.19. ſhewed themſelues to be better per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of Chriſtes omnipotencie. Sure I am, both reaſon and Chriſtes magnifying of the Centurions faith ought to leade them and all men to giue the preeminence to the Centurion aboue the other many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees. Why ſhould they not then ſee and confeſſe, that we ſhewe our ſelues more ſtrongly perſwaded of his omnipotencie then they, in that we ſhew by our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, that we firmly beleeue that he can &amp; wil, euen remaining ſtil in heauen, feed vs with his body broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; blood ſhed, though that were ſo with them, ſo long agoe, as it hath; or they, that by theirs, ſeeme to be perſwaded, that this cannot be, vnleſſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their fancy, to the ſhaking and croſſing needleſly of ſo many grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds both of good ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ners &amp; faith as we haue heard; he conuey himſelf into our mouthes? And to what purpoſe is it, for the maintena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of this their opinion, for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to labour as they do, to put infinite difference betwixt his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy vnglorified &amp; glorified, and to ſeeke to
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:2586:143"/>perſwade men, that it may be as they ſay in reſpect of his body now glorified, though not in reſpect therof before; ſeing it is moſt certaine, that when Chriſt inſtituted this Sacrament, his body was not glorified, and by his words expreſly, as I lately ſhewed, he inſtituted this to be a Sacrament of his body broken and bloode ſhed? For who doth not, or at leaſt may not heereby per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, that we haue not here any otherwiſe to deale with his eſtate glorified, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therby now the more ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gly to be perſwaded that indeed he is able to feede vs with his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken body &amp; blood ſhed once to our eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſaluation? For, that falling out ſence, and ſucceeding the inſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (wherin both by audible word, and viſible action, in breaking bread &amp; powring forth of wine &amp; calling them, as he did, he promiſed vs that) proues vnto vs inuincibly that whatſoeuer here he offred &amp; promiſed vs, either by word or deed, that he hath gone through with for vs and ſo now, that he by his reſurrection, aſcention, &amp; ſitting at the right hand of his Father, hath begot vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to a liuely hope. But vnles we would haue Chriſt otherwiſe now to be preſent to vs and our mouthes, then he was when he himſelf miniſtred it to the diſciples, and
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:2586:144"/>their mouthes in the ſtate and time of his paſſible and vnglorified bodie: let them neuer talke more of the ſtate of his glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed bodie. His wordes ſhew that this was and is a Sacrament of him dying for vs, and ſo a memoriall of his death and abaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that he vndertooke, to merit our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation by: and not of his glorie and of the life that he now hath therein, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is able to beſtow vpon his and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply vnto them whatſoeuer in his former eſtate he deſerued. The bread called his bodie broken, and the wine called his bloode ſhed, as I haue ſaid are both heere ſet before vs, ſeuered the one from the other, and by his commaundement we are bound to take as wel the one as the other, and yet the one after the other, the more forceably thereby to leade vs to the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his death and paſſion, and to feede vpon his bodie and bloode ſo hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for vs. And as his hauing not yet ſo ſuffered, letted not the Apoſtles when he firſt did inſtitute it, from yet taking oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion thereby and by his adminiſtring of it vnto them, by faith from feeding vpon his broken bodie and blood to the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of their communion with him: ſo no more doth his hauing had his
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:2586:144"/>bodie broken and bloode ſhed nowe aboue a thouſand and fiue hundred yeares agoe and neuer ſince, hinder vs from fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vpon the ſame by faith through the mightie working of his Spirit. For the ſame Chriſt that then coulde make that which was not yet done, as verelie done to their faith, and ſo to bee fed vpon as done: the ſame nowe doubtleſſe is able as eaſily to make that which was done ſo long agoe, preſent to our faith to nouriſh vs to eternall life. By this then you ſee both their reall preſence that they talke of, to be fonde and to too groſſe, and the groundes that they hold in common for the ſame to be as bad.

            </p>
            <p>And to goe on now to ſcan and examine likewiſe what they holde ſeuerally in this caſe againſt vs: it is notoriouſly knowne, the one ſorte (the fond imitators of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> I meane) would maintaine their reall preſence of his body and blood together with bread and wine in this Sacrament, when theſe common groundes of theirs that they haue with the papiſtes as they feare will not ſerue their turne, by the force and ſtrength of the trueth of the perſonall vnion of the two natures in Chriſt. Whereupon as it appeares by their
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:2586:145"/>bookes extant and confidently publiſhed about this matter, (I ſpeake it with griefe and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſion towards the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, becauſe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in the chiefeſt points of Chriſtian faith we account them our brethren, and fellow ſouldiers againſt the Antichriſtian Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue of Rome) they boldly vrge, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouch, &amp; teach, that immediatly vpon this vnion conſummate in the Virgins wombe, the natures &amp; properties of his Godhead were &amp; are ſo vnited vnto his manhood, that as the Godhead is eueriwhere, almighty &amp; of infinite maieſty &amp;c. ſo is the manhood, and therfore in this Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as they teach. Eſpecially they inſiſt vpon the being euery where of his manhood, as his Godhead is, to this purpoſe. Suppoſe the antecedent were graunted them, yet they could neuer thereupon inferre their conſequent. For when will they be able to prooue that his Godhead is ſo preſent heere with bread &amp; wine, that the receiuer of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by his mouth alwaies receiues the other? But indeede their antecedent is vntrue, abſurd, &amp; verie hetetical: &amp; but that I know, it is a moſt fearful thing before God, to haue our faith in reſpect of perſons, contrary to the rule of the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Iam.</hi> 2.1. and that the Lord will therefore moſt ſeuerely puniſh
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:2586:145"/>it, eſpecially when wilfully men will ſet themſelues to defende that which they haue but receiued from ſome perſon or perſons whom they haue in admiration, againſt a clearer trueth croſſing the ſame; I ſhould neuer make an end of wondring, that men, otherwiſe of ſuch learning and iudgement as ſome of theſe bee, euer ſhould dare, in theſe daies of ſo great light and after ſo often and manifeſt ſolemne ſentences of condemnation giuen of this their conceit in the auncient and primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Churches of Chriſt, ſet abroach ſuch an aſſertion. The vntrueth thereof appears enough, euen by that the Angels ſaying when he was riſen, <hi>He is riſen and is not heere. Math.</hi> 28.6. For ſeeing that cannot be vnderſtood of his Godhead, which is euery where, and alwaies was; it muſt of neceſſitie be vnderſtood of his manhood.

Epiſtle; and there he ſhall find, notwithſtanding they were as ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and truely perſwaded of the vnion of the two natures in Chriſt as any of theſe men be, the veritie, localitie, and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptiblenes of Chriſtes manhoode by theſe and otherplaces and argumentes ſo vrged, that any man may perceiue this their poſition was counted verie falſe in thoſe daies. The abſurditie thereof ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares in that heerein they take that to be the cauſe ſufficient of his beeing euerie where in his manhood, that can be no cauſe thereof indeed. For ſee we not naturally and inſeperably the Sunne and light and heat to be conioyned; and yet who findes not daily by experience that the globe of the bodie of the Sunne remaining ſtill in heauen, yet we heere in earth inioy both the other? Yea, many other thinges there are, which though they be vnited together,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:2586:146"/>yet whereof one ſtreacheth and reacheth further then the other: as the ſight of the eye reacheth further then the eye it ſelfe, &amp; the conceites &amp; cogitations of the mind &amp; ſoule of man further then eyther the ſoule or bodie themſelues. What an abſurd kind of reaſoning is it then for to ſay, Chriſtes Godheade and manhoode are vnited, therefore whereſoeuer the Godheade is, there muſt the manhoode be alſo. And the hereticalneſſe thereof is monſtrous and intollerable. For not onely with <hi>Marcion,</hi> it transformes Chriſtes true manhood into a meere phantaſme or imagination of ſuch a thing: but alſo in thus confounding the properties of the two natures, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundes the natures themſelues, and ſo eyther makes Chriſtes Godhead or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode with <hi>Eutiches</hi> to ſwallowe vp the one the other; or which is as abſurd, makes Chriſtes perſon to haue in it one eſtentiall and true Godhead, and an other commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated vnto his manhood beginning when the perſonall vnion of theſe two natures begonne, which ſauours ſtrongly towardes <hi>Arianiſme.</hi> Beſides all this, if this were true that they ſay, that ſtreight vpon this vnion of the two natures his manhood had the properties of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:2586:147"/>communicated vnto it; then not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the ſhaking, but to the quite ſubuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of all the Articles of our faith touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his manhood, we muſt hold, that aſſone as this vnion was conſummate in his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wombe, ſo ſoone he was there and euerie where elſe; and whiles he liued, he was not onely where he was ſeepe and heard, but alſo euery where: and the like we muſt hold to be true, when he died, was buried, deſcended into hell, roſe againe, aſcended, ſitteth at the right hand of the Father, and when he ſhall come againe to iudgement: that is, that in his verie man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, at one &amp; ſelf ſame time, he was vpon the croſſe and not vpon the croſſe, in his graue and not in his graue, that he deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended into hell and that yet he was not in hell, that he roſe againe out of his graue and did not, aſcended vp into heauen and yet tarried ſtill below in the earth, that he ſits at the right hand of his Father in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and yet is elſewhere, and that he ſhall come from thence to iudgement and yet was neuer gone from hence: becauſe at all theſe times, his Godhead was, is, and ſhall be euery where, and therefore his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode. Yea, we muſt hold, that he was at one &amp; ſelfe ſame time compaſſed in place,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:2586:147"/>and yet filled euery place; that he was paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and impaſſible; infinite, and finite; vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and inuible, in reſpect of his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; the one through the naturall condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, and the other through a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated Godhead therunto. All which eyther quite raiſe theſe Articles before touched, out of the Creed, or at leaſt they inforce vs to conceiue them in ſuch a fond ſenſe, as neither the Scriptures nor any auncient writer lead vs vnto, or incourage vs in. Heereupon it comes that in plaine tearmes, becauſe the Article of the aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is moſt vrged againſt them that they are not aſhamed, ſome of the greateſt of them; to interprete that, to be no chaunging at all of his place, but a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming inuiſible, whereas before he was viſible. By which new kinde of Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, we may ſay, that he that was ſeene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in a romth is gone out of it, he that was below is gone vp into &amp; vpper romth, if he haue but hid himſelfe behinde the curteines. And ſeeing by the ſame reaſon they muſt be driuen to inteprete the reſt in like manner, hereupon alſo it will followe, that his leauing his mothers wombe, and his riſing out of the graue, and therefore his not beeing founde
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:2586:148"/>there in his bodie, was but a deceiuing of the ſenſes of his mother, and of thoſe that ſought him in his graue and could not finde him: for he was there ſtil though ſhe thought that ſhe was quite deliuered of him, and they could not finde him there. So alſo by this when he was dying vpon the croſſe viſibly in all other places, he was inuiſibly in his verie ſame manhood aliue, and not toucht by his enemies. O what a ridiculous, monſtrous and fooliſh aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is this, whereupon all theſe moſt groſſe abſurdities both againſt reaſon and all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion follow! Who can once enter but into the view thereof whoſe heart withall will not tremble and quake, and for the horrour thereof be extre emely amazed and aſtonied? The Lordes name there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for euer be bleſſed that hitherto hath kept theſe our Churches from the infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the poyſon heereof; and I beſeech him for his Chriſtes ſake, that for euer he would vouchſafe ſo to doe ſtill. <hi>Luther</hi> neuer ſought to defend his Conſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with this: yea his beſt friendes that he had, and amongſt them that famous lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man <hi>Phillip Melancton</hi> plainely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porte, that yet he was brought to ſee his errour therein ere he died, though he liued
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:2586:148"/>not to raſe it out of his bookes. Since his prepoſterous followers of a wilful eagernes to maintaine that which once heerein they had vndertooke, beeing driuen to ſee the weakneſſe of the former groundes that they had before common with the papiſts haue as with the furious tempeſt of conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thus runne themſelues vpon this rocke. The Lond in his mercy graunt them in time to ſee their folly, that they may beartily repent heereof, and of the deſtruction of the Churches of Chriſt; whereof by this meanes they haue beene perilous authors. <hi>Amen.

But whither will not fooliſh man runne when once he hath left the beaten way of the Lord in his word, to follow his owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe and conceite? Chriſtes offering of himſelfe, by himſelfe, doubtleſſe was neuer applied to the good of any that whiles they were aliue tooke not hold of it: and yet ſuch is the impudencie of theſe men, that nowe they hold the intention of their Prieſt in ſaying of his Maſſe, ſhall carie the benefit of this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice whether he liſt, to liue or dead. Yea heereby ſeeing their credit growe as it hath, and their gaines come row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in, they haue not beene aſhamed not yet are in this greate light, to make their ſacrifice in the Maſſe a ſalue for all ſores, and phiſicke for all diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes both of man and beaſt. Well yet this is not all the miſchiefe that their conceit of reall preſence by tranſubſtantiation hath brought them vnto. For beſides this, heereupon they are growne euen to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and worſhippe their hoaſtes once
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:2586:151"/>conſecrated, euen as Chriſt himſelfe; and therefore whereas Chriſt comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that which he eate, brake, and gaue, to be eaten ſtreight, they hoyſt it vp ouer their heades, that all the people may gaze vpon it, adore and worſhippe it for their Chriſt and Sauiour: and then when they haue plaide with it their fill, for the moſt part they eate vp all themſelues alone, that be the maſſing prieſtes, and if they leaue anie them they hang vp in a Pixe ouer the Altar, to ſerue them an other time; which all commers into the Church in the meane time muſt adore and reuerence, though ſo hanged vp and hidden from their eyes. Wherein doubtleſſe they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte moſt groſſe idolatrie. For firſt they themſelues manie of them holde that the prieſt muſt haue an intention to conſecrate; or elſe though he vtter the wordes, there followes no tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation thereupon: and therefore wiſedome woulde if they had anye care to auoyde Idolatrie, that they ſhoulde be ſure of the prieſtes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, before they fell to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippinge of the hoaſte, or rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they can neuer bee ſure of
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:2586:152"/>that becauſe no man can know a mans thought but himſelfe, and euery one can and often doth diſſemble and make ſhow to thinke that which he doth not, they ſhould and would, if there were any feare of God in them, vtterlie abſtaine there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from. Againe vnto this day they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not agree amongeſt themſelues of the wordes and meanes of conſecration: their Schoolemen I am ſure <hi>Scotus, Petrus de A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaco, Occam, Thomas Aquinas, Durand,</hi> and others wonderfully haue iarred about this matter, and as yet I cannot finde they are fully agreed. In the meane time ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whiles they be, they ſhould in all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be better aduiſed what they doe. But to let theſe reaſons alone, who can or may thinke that it can ſtand with Chriſtes ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 4.24. <hi>God is a ſpirit, and they that worſhip him muſt worſhip him in ſpirit and trueth,</hi> that they ſhould nowe thus worſhip a wafer cake in ſhew and taſt for verie Chriſt? I am truely perſwaded that there hath beene no one thing that hath more hardned the hearts eyther of Turkes or Iewes from becomming Chriſtians, then to heare and ſee as they doe, theſe men thus to worſhip theſe wafer Chriſies of theirs; who yet would be accounted
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:2586:152"/>the onely good Chriſtians. And it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine euen for this the heathen Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooner and Phiſition <hi>Auerois,</hi> (though he by trauelling and reading was acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with wonderfull many fooliſh &amp; fond kindes of Idolatrie) liuing and floriſhing about the yeare of Chriſt noo. iudged Chriſtians to be the moſt fooliſh Idolaters in the world. And without all doubt this hath beene averie God <hi>Manzim,</hi> that is, of power and riches to them. For the people beeing perſwaded that their prieſts can turne ſo quickly a poore wafer into Chriſt their Sauiour, and that they can at their pleaſure offer him vnto his Father for their ſoules health both whiles they are aliue and when they are dead they haue not cared what honour and riches they haue beſtowed vpon them. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not vnfitlie may that of <hi>Daniell</hi> be as well verified of them euen for this, as of them of whome he ſpoke moſt properlie and litterally, <hi>That they honour the God Mauzim, a God whom their Fathers knew not, Dan.</hi> 11.38. And yet behold if we goe on but a little further, more iniquitie and impietie in their Maſte then all theſe. For therein they haue quite contrarie to Chriſtes inſtitution, by abſurdlie taking
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:2586:153"/>it to be a ſacrament of Chriſtes life,
<note place="margin">That they miniſter it but in one kinde.</note> and ſo of his bodie and bloode now togither in his manhood in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, (wheras he left it to be a ſacrament of his death, and ſo of the ſundring therby of the one from the other, as I haue ſhewed,) and by a new deuiſe of Concomitance, that is of the going of his bodie &amp; blood now alwaies together, robd the common people of the one half of the Sacrament, denying the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the cup, &amp; telling them that in taking the hoaſt, they take al; for his body &amp; blood are &amp; goe now togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But if it were thus, why do they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues take both; or would they haue vs to think it needful for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to eat him once vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the form of bread, &amp; after to drink him againe vnder the forme of wine, &amp; that the one is inough for the people? Euident it is in the words of the inſtitution, and by the practiſe therof in <hi>Pauls</hi> time, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. that al were as expreſly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded to drinke of the cup, as to eate of the other. But Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the wiſedome of the Father, had not ſo much wiſdom &amp; forecaſt as theſe men belike, to foreſee that his body &amp; blood go togither, &amp; therfore for lacke of foreſight he ordained a ſuperfluous thing. What an intollerable pride and preſumption is this that duſt and aſhes, and ſinnefull man
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:2586:153"/>ſhall thus vndertake to alter &amp; to controule the ordinance of our Lord and ſauiour? Before the Councel of Conſtance, which was in the yeare, 1414. we finde not the adminiſtring of this Sacrament vnder both kindes, generally and publiklie for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid the common communicant. And in the councell of Baſil about ſome 16. years after, for all that, it was permitted to the Boemians againe. <hi>De conſecratione diſt.</hi> 2. <hi>Gratian</hi> alleages a decree of <hi>Gelaſius</hi> a Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> a thouſand yeares agoe, to binde all men to receiue in both kinds, ſaying; either let him that receiueth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue both, or neither, becauſe the diuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of one miſterie cannot be without ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge.

<pb n="285" facs="tcp:2586:155"/>ſpeciall minion and paragon Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration: and therefore vntill her braines be daſht out there will neuer be any hoe of their fooliſhneſſe and madneſſe in this maſſe and Chaos of confuſion of theirs. They would beare the world in hand that ſhe is moſt ancient and yet indeede and trueth how long ſoeuer before they were in conceiuing of her, yet ſhe was neuer growne ripe to the birth or borne before <hi>Innocent</hi> the thirdes time. For neuer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Laterane councell, which was in his time and in the yeere 1211. (as I haue ſaid before,) was this decreed to be a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike trueth amongſt themſelues. And this their owne greate Doctor and Biſhop <hi>Tonſtall</hi> in a booke of his written of this matter confeſſeth adding, that perhaps it had beene better to haue leſs the manner how Chriſt becommeth preſent in this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, as it was before that councell. Now before this, the Greeke Church was departed from the Church of Rome, and therefore this was rather the decree of a priuate and particular conuenticle then of the vniuerſall Church of God; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not onely wee, but ſtill vnto this day the Greekes reiect both this councell and decree, though I know much tempering
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:2586:156"/>hath beene with them ſince to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. <hi>Scotus</hi> is not onelie of the ſame minde with <hi>Tonſtall,</hi> but if you reade him, <hi>diſt.</hi> 11, <hi>quaeſt.</hi> 3. vpon the 48. booke of Sentences, you ſhall not only finde, that he bringeth a number of obiections againſt this, which he neuer anſwereth to anie purpoſe but alſo that in the end, he ſetting downe his ſole determination for it, that yet moſt plainely he confeſſeth, that the principall ground of interpreting Chriſtes wordes by tranſubſtantiation, is this, that <hi>de ſacramentis tenendum eſt ſicat tenet ſancta Eccleſia Romana:</hi> of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, we muſt hold as the holy Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine Church holdeth. For the which axiome, or rule, in ſo weightie a matter, in his next wordes he ſhewes, that the beſt grounde he had, was an Extraua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant, <hi>de haereticis, Cap. ad abolendam,</hi> wherein ſome ſuch things be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, by a ſauorite of the ſame. Which is as good ouidence, as if we ſhoulde aske a theoues follow, whether he be a theife, if not worſe. <hi>Gabriell Biell</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other great Doctor of theirs, writing vpon the Canon of the Maſſe, confeſſeth that it is not expreſſed in the Canon of the Bible, whether by tranſubſtantiation,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:2586:156"/>or conſubſtantiation, the bodie of Chriſt be there. And <hi>Iohn Fiſher</hi> a biſhop and martyr of theirs, as they count him, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt <hi>Luthers</hi> booke of the capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie of <hi>Babilon,</hi> thinketh that euerye man vnderſtandeth that the certaintie of that matter dependes not ſo much of the Goſpell, as it doth vpon the vſe, tradition, and cuſtome of the Church.

Truely it was not <hi>Marke</hi> the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangeliſt nor any ſuch; but yet vnleſſe I be much deceiued, one <hi>Marke</hi> markt them out the way the firſt of all others to finde it out. This <hi>Marke</hi> that I ſpeake of, was a ſamous Magition and a damnable filthie heretique of the brood of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>alenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians,</hi> a verie ancient one (I muſt needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe.) For I finde that he liued in the time of the Emperor <hi>Antarinus Pius</hi> which was but 150. yeares after Chriſt. Of this wretch writeth <hi>Epiphanius</hi> in his 34. hereſie, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that which he ſaith out of <hi>Irenaus</hi> his 9. chapter againſt the hereſies of the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinians, where indeed it is ſo teſtified of him, that when by his enchantment or ink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling he had cauſed a cup of white wine to beare the colour of blood, that the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he made his fellowe beleeue that by his inuocation ouer it, it was ſo tranſubſtantiated into blood, that ſo by his meanes it might be thought that the grace that is <hi>ſuper vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa</hi> that is, oner all, had inſtilled <hi>ſanguinem ſuum in illud poculum,</hi> his bloode unto that cup: by which meanes when he had made them in admiration of him and ſo deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to drinke there of, he gaue them (as it
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:2586:157"/>is there noted) with greate ſolemnitie of wordes, and ſo wonderfully bewitched many. And the rather was I led and am thus to thinke, becauſe the ſame <hi>Irenaeus</hi> in the 8. chapter of the ſaid booke (ſecretly directed as I take it by the ſpirit of prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie) ſaid that he was <hi>verè pracurſor Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſti,</hi> that is, truely Antichriſtes forerun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. If therefore the former nouitie of their tranſubſtantiation pleaſe them not, let them hence fetch the petigree therof, and ſo let <hi>Marcus</hi> be the firſt conceiuer of it, and <hi>Innocentius</hi> he that bore and brought it forth. Or if this be not to their mindes, I will confeſſe that it may be that they learned it of the heathen, who as they imagined with certaine words &amp; geſtures could call downe their <hi>Hecate, Iupiter,</hi> and <hi>Elicius</hi> as oft as they liſt. For neuer made or at this day maketh any heathen man more adoe then they about this buſineſſe, about the moſt idolatrous toy of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition that euer they went about. For the wordes muſt be pronounced with one breath, and they vſe ſuch croſſing ſuch bending and bowing, breathing and haling of the wordes to the elementes, as they make themſelues verie ridiculous to any that are wiſe that ſee them &amp; marke
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:2586:158"/>their doings. No iugler nor ſycophant vpon a ſtage are more full of fond and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling actions and geſtures then a Prieſt at Maſſe, and all to effect this their tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation. Who can be perſwaded that the Lord of heauen and earth that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth in no vanitie, but altogether in ſinceritie and ſimplicitie, can take delight in this geare? Whiles they haue beene ſo buſie to eſtabliſh the credite of this their deuiſe by fonde tales of diuerſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles ſhowed heere and there, and I cannot tell where, it had beene more needefull for them to haue laboured firſt to agree amongeſt themſelues about the matter, and to cleare the doubtes that they haue moued themſelues by occaſion thereof. But this hitherto they haue founde ſo comberſome a thing to doe, that I dare be bolde to ſay by that which I haue red and coulde ſet downe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the varieties of their opinions and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate doubtes heereupon moued by themſelues, and vnanſwered and vnſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied as yet, would require a longer time than I haue yet ſpent ſince I began to talke of this Sacrament, to ſet them downe in. Yea though they vſe and like the word Tranſubſtantiation neuer ſo well, yet
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:2586:158"/>though they know that both by the words of the inſtitution, and by Saint <hi>Paules</hi> ſpeaches had thereof, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.11. and by the teſtimonies with one conſent of all the ancient Fathers, as we haue often ſhewed them, Chriſt called vndoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the bread which he brake and gaue, his bodie broken; and the wine in the cup his bloodſhed, they cannot yet be brought to tell vs or to agree amongſt themſelues, what it is that ſhould be or is heere tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiated and conuerted into his body. Nay in trueth they dare not ſay that eyther bread or wine or any thing elſe are the thinges: and yet we muſt yealde to a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation though no man yet could or would tell vs, and ſtand to it when he hath done, whereof it is. Howſoeuer, eyther they muſt ſay it is of ſome thing, or not: if of any thing, then they know that therupon it will follow that of that thing, whatſoeuer it be, here Chriſts bodie is made; which is abſurd they themſelues ſeeme to thinke; &amp; to ſay nothing is turned or tranſubſtantiated into it, is quite to looſe their cauſe. In very deed they are inforced to ſee, that if they ſhould once by the demo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtratiue particle This that Chriſt vſed, vnderſtand the bread &amp; wine, that then it would moſt cleerly follow that
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:2586:159"/>there is a Trope or figure in the ſpeech of Chriſt, or that elſe they muſt confeſſe bread and wine to be turned into the bodie and bloode of Chriſt, and therefore to ſhune both theſe ſtraites they cannot tell what to vnderſtand by it, and ſo are at their wittes end. By that which they ſay and doc they yet are reſolute that they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uey and banniſh away the ſubſtances of bread and wine, and leaue nothing but the bare accidents thereof, vnder which they hold luſtilie Chriſt to be fleſh, blood &amp; bone. And therefore they ſing merilie in their Hymne or Carrol vpon <hi>Corpus Chriſti</hi> day, <hi>Sub diuerſis ſpeciebus, ſignis tantùm &amp; non rebus, latent res eximiae, caro, ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, ſangnis, potus, manet homo Chriſtus totus, ſub vtraque ſpecie: a ſumente non conciſus, non confractus, nec diuiſus integer accipitur, &amp;c.</hi> that is, Vnder diuerſe kinds, ſignes onely and not thinges, moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent thinges lie hid, fleſh, meate, bloode, drinke, yea whole Chriſt abideth vnder eyther kinde: of the taker not bruiſed not broken, nor deuided but whole is he taken. But for all this their ſturre it ſhould ſeeme yet that nowe they are perſwaded they haue him rather by banniſhing of bread and wine (though they cannot tell
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:2586:159"/>eyther how, whither, or into what,) then by tranſubſtantiation of breade and wine thereinto or of anything elſe. Howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it were or bee, that there ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine nothing but the bare accidentes or out ward formes of bread and wine that is inough vtterly to ouerthrow the nature of the Sacrament. For in Sacramentes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies there muſt bee an Analogie betwixt the ſignes and the thinges ſignified, which cannot be betwixt bare accidents of bread and wine, (for that they alone feede not at all) and the bodie and blood of Chriſt which are our foode to eternall life: and therfore to aboliſh or abandon by what meanes ſoeuer bread &amp; wine, is to deſtroy quite the nature of the Sacrament. That the verie ſubſtances thereof remaine for all their prating, when they haue vſed all their art &amp; the trickes therof they can, both Scripture, Fathers, and reaſon make it moſt euident. For in the wordes of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, ſcanne and marke them wel who liſt, it is moſt cleare that Chriſt tooke verie bread and wine, and that he both gaue that which he tooke and that they tooke the ſame and no other, though by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution now chaunged in name, vſe, and eſtimation as I haue ſaid. And therefore
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:2586:160"/>
               <hi>Paule</hi> retaineth the name of the bread and cup ſtill, euen when they come to be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and drunken vpon, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. and Chriſt calles it the fruite of the vine tree, and that after he had deliuered it, and they had drunken therof. <hi>Mar.</hi> 14.25. And in all other Sacramentes as we haue hearde, though the like phraſe of ſpeach haue bene vſed, yet alwaies haue they beene fulland forcible Sacramentes to offer, to deliuer, and to ſeale the deliuerie of the inwarde grace thereby intended to the right recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, without any ſuch aboliſhing or tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiating of the outwarde elements thereinto, as is heere imagined. And if Chriſt had had anie ſuch purpoſe, it had ſure beene as eaſie a matter with him to haue vttered his minde in and by wordes ſounding plainely that he ment to effect ſome ſuch thing (as by ſaying, this is turned into my bodie, or let this be tranſubſtantiated thereinto, or let the ſubſtance of this ceaſe, and in the romph thereof let my bodie come and bee) as onely to haue ſaide affirmatiuelie that it was his bodie. But hauing but ſaide ſo, it is moſt certaine it was ſome certaine thing that he affirmed to be ſo: for he would neuer call bare nothing or an <hi>indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiduum
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:2586:160"/>vagum,</hi> an vncertaine thing, (as <hi>Gardiner</hi> holds he ment by This) his bodie. And therefore wil they nil they, by Chriſts words interpreted as they doe, eyther we muſt haue Chriſtes bodie, which once was of the nature of the Virgin his Mother (that ſo he might be that ſeede of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to treade downe the ſerpentes head, and in whome all the nations of the world ſhoulde be bleſſed) whenſoeuer any of their prieſtes therby intend to conſecrate (as they ſpeake) made of a wafer againe; or at leaſt now growne to be ſuch an one as that it can lie hid vnder the forme ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the ſubſtance of breade beeing gone to giue it romph. But once againe I muſt tel them that the words of Chriſt are ſo farre from ſounding any ſuch thing, as that if they ſhould be taken litterally as they ſound, they rather ſhew that his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and blood were become bread &amp; wine or turned thereinto, then the contrary. For when <hi>Moſes</hi> rod was turned into a ſerpent, or when <hi>Lots</hi> wife was turned into a pillar of ſalt, if one ſhoulde haue ſaide of the one that it was <hi>Moſes</hi> rod, or of the other that it was <hi>Lots</hi> wife, woulde anie thereby haue vnderſtoode that he mente that the ſcrpent was tranſubſtantiated into the
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:2586:161"/>rod or the pillar of ſalt into <hi>Lots</hi> wife, nay would not the verie ſounde of the wordes moſt plainly lead any man rather to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that his meaning was to ſhew <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> rod was turned into the ſerpent, and <hi>Lots</hi> wife into the pillar of ſalt? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they haue not onely no ground in the Scriptures for this their opinion, but not onely other ſcriptures but the verie words of the inſtitution are directly againſt them. And the ancient Fathers are plaine that though Chriſt called breade and wine his bodie broken and his blood ſhed, that yet neyther by tranſubſtantion nor anie way elſe the ſubſtances thereof are gone. <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odoret</hi> both in his firſt Dialogue &amp; ſecond alſo, though moſt plainely (as I haue noted alreadie) he confeſſe that Chriſt honored bread and wine with the names of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and blood, moſt flatly ſaith that yet he changed not their natures but added grace to nature, and that the myſticall ſignes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſanctification (as he pleaſeth to ſpeake) goe not from their nature, figure or forme. And <hi>Gelaſius</hi> againſt <hi>Eutiches</hi> writeth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly that in the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> the nature of bread and wine ceaſe not. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> alſo, as <hi>Gratian</hi> alledgeth him <hi>De conſecr. diſt.</hi> 2. <hi>cap. p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

And if we would know in what ſenſe and ſort they are chaunged into another thing remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning alſo ſtill the ſame that they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the ſame <hi>Gratian</hi> a little before in the chapter <hi>quia corpus,</hi> teacheth vs to learne that of our ſelues by the chaunge that we finde in our ſelues by regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that out of <hi>Euſebius Emiſſenus;</hi> which as he noteth and we all know is true not at all in reſpect of outward ſubſtance (for that is the ſame in vs when we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate that it was before) but onelie of inward grace and qualitie, which is that which I call heere in this Sacrament an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of the outward elementes in name vſe and eſtimation. <hi>Bertram</hi> in a ſet trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe written of this matter as it is thought in <hi>Carolus Calunus</hi> time, by manie argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes proues bread and wine ſtill to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine. And <hi>Elfricke</hi> about the yeare 996. (as <hi>Fox</hi> noteth) in two Saxon Epiſtles, which to that ende he recordes, therein taught bread and wine heere no otherwiſe to be the bodie and bloode of Chriſt,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:2586:162"/>then Manna and the water of the rocke in the wildernes were Chriſt, which all men knowe they were but by repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſignification, and not really; for that then Chriſt was not become man. And the ſame man, as maiſter <hi>Fox</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, tranſlated a ſermon out of Latine into the Saxon tongue (which he inſertes wholly in his ſtory alſo) by him then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be red on Eaſter day to the Saxons inhabiting then this land; which who ſo readeth ſhal finde that it contains much direct matter &amp; proofe, both againſt tranſubſtantiation, and groſſe reall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence built thereupon. In <hi>Bedes</hi> time alſo, who died about the yeare 734. the ſame doctrine was continued heere and elſewhere, as it appeareth by that which he hath written vpon the inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as it is ſet downe by <hi>Luke</hi> 22. where he ſhewes (as I haue noted before) not onely the likelyhoode of the vſe of bread and wine in nouriſhing and cheering our bodies, to be the cauſe they beare the names of the bodie and blood of Chriſt, which ſemblablie nouriſh and feede our ſoules: but alſo he ſo ſpeaketh and writeth thereof, that yet he ſhewes he tooke them to be bread and wine ſtill. And as by this
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:2586:162"/>you may ſee then that both Scriptures and Fathers are againſt them herein, ſo queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onles is all ſound reaſon, moſt ſtronglye: which as long as it is not controwled or croſt, either by the doctrine of faith, or good manners taught in the Scriptures, is worth the liſtening vnto. Now reaſon and all our ſences, and the experience that we haue had and may haue of the ſowre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the wine, of the mouling and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting of the hoaſts, ſo that wormes may and haue bred thereof, and that Dogges, Battes, Rattes, and Miſe, and ſo not onely vnbeleeuers can feede thereof, are moſt ſure euidence vnto vs, that for all their great brags to the contrary, with all their croſſing, whiſpering, breathing, becking and doucking, and demure pronuncing of the words, they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not neither once remoue the ſubſtances of bread and wine away, nor bring Chriſtes bodie or blood into the romphs thereof. For neither can theſe things that I haue ſpoken of, all or any of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be incident to bare accidents, neither yet to the moſt precious body &amp; blood of Chriſt Ieſus God and man. For who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not that bare accidents are not, nor can be ſubiectes of ſuch ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents as theſe bee? Neither can
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:2586:163"/>they be matter to nouriſh and feed eyther man or beaſt withal, or to breede any ſuch thinges vpon. And howſoeuer theſe men can finde in their heartes to grant that the bodie of the Chriſt whom they ſerue may be ſubiect to all theſe thinges, ſure I am the bodie of the true Chriſt (that the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> might be verified ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, <hi>Thou wilt not ſuffer thy holie one to ſee corruption, Pſal.</hi> 16.10.) could not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie be helde of death vntill it rotte: and therefore much leſſe will the heauenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther now that it is glorified, let it be eyther meat for ſuch filthie vermin or for the mouthes of wicked men, or to be ſubiect to putrefaction that wormes ſhal breede ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But I knowe though ſome of them haue not beene aſhamed to ſaie that he can and may be eaten of ſuch beaſtes as well as of ſuch men (whereof none of them now doubt;) yet generally they ſay when ſuch thinges fall out with the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward elements as I haue ſpoken of, then Chriſt by his almightie power conueyeth himſelfe away, and lets the olde ſubſtances come againe and ioyne themſelues with their accidentes. In the meane time then I would the beſt ſtudied of them in this point could eyther tell vs what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comde
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:2586:163"/>in the meane time of the ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or how their accidentes were kept or vnderpropt without ſubſtances, and ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes to be in. And if it were granted then that Chriſt to exempt and to preſerue his bodie from theſe inconueniences re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moues it away before any of theſe can fal out vnto it, yet then they graunt that the beſt ſhift that their popiſh Chriſt hath in this caſe is to runne away or to giue place. Such a Chriſt may become ſuch kinde of Chriſtians; but ſurely the wiſe hearted Chriſtians would be loth to truſt to ſuch a Chriſt for their ſaluation whoſe beſt ſhift is thus to flie that a Mouſe eate him not; and I would aduiſe them not to truſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues too much to ſuch a daſtardly Chriſt. I would thinke that they ſhould &amp; would rather hold that he driues all theſe away, then that indeede he ſhould be driuen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of any of them: and that therefore when any ſuch thing ſeemeth to fall out otherwiſe, eyther the prieſt conſecrated not well, and ſo failed and came ſhort of tranſubſtantiation, or that the ſences are deceiued in thinking any ſuch thing in haue happened. But ſeeing they like better to prouide for their Chriſt by his ſuddaine departure, I would haue them to tell mee,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:2586:164"/>whether they worke a greater miracle in tranſubſtantiating breade and wine into him, or theſe kinde of cattell in traſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiating him againe into the old bread and wine; And I would be glad once to here a ſubſtantiall reaſon, why Chriſts wordes ſhould not, or did not proue as power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to driue the accidents away as the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, or why they beleeuing, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Chriſts plaine wordes, that accidents of bread and wine remaine, becauſe the ſenſes telles them ſo, they ſhould not, or will not beleeue the ſame ſenſes, as plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſuring them that the ſubſtances them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues alſo remaine, that therefore they are there alſo. But what ſhould I trouble my ſelfe by reaſon and ſenſe to confute them, which as it ſhould ſeeme haue here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, for the maintenance of their owne wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful conceit, pride, pompe &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie, loſt both ſenſe, reaſon, and religion. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to all ſuch as haue theſe, I truſt I haue ſaid ſufficient, to make not onely the verity of our owne doctrine, touching this Sacrament, ſufficiently to appeare, but alſo to the full diſplaying &amp; diſgraſing for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer with ſuch of the vanity of both theſe our aduerſaries herein. Wherefore to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to my text, and ſo to goe on againe
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:2586:164"/>therewith, I hope yet by this that I haue ſaide of this matter, you now plainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, that notwithſtanding the doctrine and vſe of this Sacrament, the vnion and communion that we muſt ſeeke to haue with Chriſt, though it be true &amp; reall in reſpect of him and vs, the perſons &amp; things to be vnited; that yet it is not groſſe &amp; car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, to be attained vnto by the inſtruments or members of our bodie at all, as theſe our aduerſaries teach: but that by the worde &amp; Sacraments, God offers him vnto vs, and by his Spirit communicateth him vnto vs, after a ſpirituall and miſticall manner, and that we by faith wrought and nouriſhed in vs by this his Spirit and meanes, feed vpon to our euerlaſting ſaluation.</p>
            <p>Touching which faith,
<note place="margin">Concluſion of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.</note> which thus I haue made as it were the hand &amp; mouth of our ſoule to take Chriſt offered vnto vs in the word &amp; Sacraments withall, at the hand of God hsi ſpirit; let it be remembred once againe, that Chriſt here in my text, calling for it, to drinke him by, ſaith not ſimply, <hi>he that beleeueth in mee,</hi> but with this aditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>as ſaith the Scripture.</hi> Wherby let vs, to conclude this point withall, learne that in this caſe, it is not inough to beleeue as we liſt, nor as this man or that, this company or that teach vs alwayes: Yea that we neuer
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:2586:165"/>beleeue aright to this purpoſe vntill we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in Chriſt as the canonicall Scriptures teach vs. All which (as I haue before ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently ſhewed) lay him ſtill before vs to be beleeued in as our ſole and onely meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious cauſe of our ſaluation; with whom we may neither ioyne any other perſon or thing. And ſo ſtedfaſt alſo our confidence of ſaluation theſe teach vs ought to be in him, that thereby we may ſay, <hi>We haue peace with God through him, and ſuch acceſſe to Gods grace, as that we ſtand therin and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce vnder hope which ſhall neuer be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded. Rom.</hi> 5. <hi>verſ.</hi> 1.2.3. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In ſo much that hauing reckoned vp all thinges that are moſt likely to doe it, yet with <hi>Paule</hi> all that haue this faith may boldly and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphantly ſay, <hi>That nothing ſhall ſeperate them from the loue of God which is in Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> In any caſe therefore by the meanes that he hath appointed for that purpoſe (which I haue now alſo laide before you) let vs ſtriue to attaine to this faith and to nouriſh it when we haue once got it. For this is it that ioyneth Chriſt and vs togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſo fully poſſeſſeth vs of him and all the treaſured graces and mercies of God prouided for mens ſaluation in him, that therefore it bringeth vnto vs the peace
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:2586:165"/>that paſſeth all vnderſtanding, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.7. and the ioy that none can euer take from vs. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 16.22. We haue the word of God and that written, outwardly ſealed in the Sacramentes, and thereby, by his ſpirit al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo inwardly offering to ſeale &amp; ſealing the ſame vnto our heartes &amp; conſciences, that God the Father in and by his ſonne Chriſt Ieſus, by the mightie working of the holie Ghoſt both can and will ſaue vs. Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer therefore papiſtes prate to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, let vs moſt firmly and conſtantlie thus beleeue, and not once dare call the trueth of God, thus many waies confirmed vnto vs, once into queſtion. But then let vs neuer for get that golden ſaying of <hi>Cyprian, De duplicimartirio. Non credit in Deum, qui non in eo ſolo collocat totius ſuae ſalut is fiducia:</hi> that is, He beleeues not in God at all, that placeth not the whole confidence of his ſaluation in him alone. And the rather for that thus to doe our Creedes, our Baptiſme and all the ſcriptures teach vs. Let vs not therefore by the example or doctrine of Papiſtes, be drawne from hence to put our confidence, as they doe, both in a number of perſons and things that are not God. For that were vndoubtedly (howſoeuer they would perſwade men to the contrary) no
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:2586:166"/>better than to become plaine reuolters and apoſtares from the ancient found Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke faith, which all theſe moſt plainely teach and binde vs vnto, and in deede to fet vp vnto our ſelues a new Chriſt of our owne deuiſing, with whom none of theſe euer acquainted vs. Wherefore as in theſe reſpectes I would wiſh that we tooke heed of the ſeauen of the popiſh faith, as of the verie baine &amp; poyſon of our ſoules; ſo alſo beware we of their kinde of faith in the vſe of the Sacrament of the body &amp; bloode of Chriſt. For as you may perceiue by that which I haue ſaid already of that matter, the faith that they moſt call for in that buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes is, a beleeuing that Chriſtes very body &amp; blood are really there vnder the formes of bread &amp; wine, &amp; ſo be taken in &amp; by the bodily mouth of euery receiuer, quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie both to the true ſence of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turs in that behalf, &amp; to the nature of Chriſt. Theſe things thus finiſhed and concluded, it remaineth now that we proceede in our text: wherein we haue yet to conſider of the promiſe therin made by Chriſt to all thoſe and to none but to thoſe that by right knowing him, and beleeuing in him, come vnto him, and drinke of him.</p>
            <pb n="307" facs="tcp:2586:166"/>
            <p>This promiſe he vtters and expreſſes in theſe wordes as you haue hearde,
<note place="margin">The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</note> 
               <hi>out of his bellie ſhall flowe riuers of water of life,</hi> whereunto if we referre theſe wordes, <hi>as ſaith the Scripture,</hi> (as many interpreters both olde and newe doe,) then they teach vs to vnderſtand this promiſe, as the Scripture teacheth vs ellewhere, and not otherwiſe. And ſeeing Chriſt hath vttered the promiſe in ſuch a metaphoricall phraſe as hee hath, it may verie well be that of very purpoſe he placed thoſe wordes as he did, not onely to teach vs as we haue heard alreadie, that we come vnto him and drinke of him, by ſound knowledge and right faith as the Scriptures ſhew vs; but alſo plainelie to inſtruct vs, that in ſo doing we muſt looke to haue the wordes of this promiſe fulfilled vnto vs, not in any groſſe or literall ſence, but onelie in ſuch ſpirituall manner and ſorte, as the Scriptures themſelues in other places declare. Heereby then to beginne withall, Chriſt hath giuen vs this moſte notable and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable rule, that it is a moſte ſounde way, rightile to expounde Scriptures, and ſo rightlie to vnderſtande them, to
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:2586:167"/>conferre Scripture with Scripture, and to admit no ſence of figuratiue and darke phraſes and ſpeaches in the ſame, but that which may &amp; doth ſtand with other more plaine places, which in Gods wiſedom and prouidence euen of purpoſe elſewhere are ſet downe therein, that they may be as a key to let vs into the right ſence of the harde: than which rule (howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer nowe a daies our aduerſaries would perſwade they haue founde a better, namely to make the current practiſe of their Church; which when they haue braued of Doctors and Councelles ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo much, is indeede onely the verie pleaſure &amp; mutable fanſie of their Popes) the ancient Fathers haue eſteemed and followed this as the beſt and ſaifeſt. As it is euident in <hi>Auguſtine, De doctrina Chriſtiana, Lib.</hi> 3.2.6. where he defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth that to be alwaies the ſence of the harde place, which is taught in plainer; and that no ſence is to be receiued to be the ſence of any, which cannot be proued ſo to be out of other places. Of the ſame minde <hi>Hierome</hi> ſhowes himſelfe to haue beene in his 19. Homilie vpon <hi>Eſay,</hi> noting that therefore it is the faſhion of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures after hard things to ioyne other that
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:2586:167"/>be plaine. <hi>Origen</hi> alſo in his firſt Homilie of <hi>Hierimie,</hi> and <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> in diuers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, namely writing of the holy Ghoſt, and in his 12. Homtlie vpon <hi>Geneſis,</hi> are moſt pregnant in this point; the one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecting all ſences and interpretations as of no credit without warrant from other ſcriptures, and the other affirming plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the ſcriptures ſo expounde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues that they ſuffer not the Reader to erre. Whereupon no man, no not amongſt vs, is more earneſt to vrge all ſortes of men to read the ſcriptures, than <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> as any man may ſee in his 9.

And for as much as when theſe wordes were firſt vttered by Chriſt, then the Canonicall ſcriptures onely of the olde Teſtament were written, it ſhalbe moſt fit to looke into them for this purpoſe. Wherein to this end verie pertinent it is, that the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed man (which doubtleſſe he is that commeth vnto Chriſt, and drinketh of him aright) is deſcribed in the firſt Pſalme to be <hi>like a tree planted by the riuers

For there, after that the thirſty are ſolemnly (as it were) by way of procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, called and allured <hi>to come to the waters, and ſo freely, being come, to drinke wine and to cate milke and that which was fatte and good;</hi> a promiſe is made them if they would ſo do, <hi>that they ſhould liue and enioy the ſure mercies of Dauid.</hi> That alſo, <hi>Eſay.</hi> 59.20.21. may well be as a Commentarie vpon this, where after that it is ſaid that <hi>the redeemer ſhall come vnto Sion,</hi> it is ſaide, that <hi>this couenant ſhalbe made with them that turne from iniquitie in Iacob, that his ſpirite and word ſhoulde neuer departe from them, nor from their ſeede after them:</hi> which couenante or promiſe is more fully opened, <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie.</hi> 31.33.34. vnto which time of the comming of the Meſſiah, and the performance of this promiſe then, <hi>Ioell</hi> hauing an eye, he bringeth in GOD promiſing then, <hi>that he woulde poure

Reuel.</hi> 22. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 1. than the holy Ghoſt proceeding and flowing from the father and the ſonne, to cheere and to make fruitful the Citizens of the heauenly <hi>Hieruſalem.</hi> And by that <hi>water of life,</hi> which Chriſt taught the woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> to aſke of him, &amp; whereof if a man drinke, he ſaide <hi>he ſhould neuer thirſt againe, for that it ſhould be in him, a well of water, ſpringing vp to euerlaſting life,</hi> noe doubt of it, he vnderſtoode nothing elſe but the Spirit, which he would beſtow v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon all his, to regenerate and ſanctifie them effectually withall. Hereby then you may ſee, not only this interpretation iuſtified, that by riuers of water of life flowing out of the bellies of ſuch as come vnto Chriſt, and rightly make him their owne by drinking of him, we are to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Spirit of God and the plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull graces thereof, promiſed to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; but alſo that this is a Metaphore ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fit &amp; apt to expreſſe the ſame, or elſe that God woulde neuer haue ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted therein, as thus by the often vſing it he ſheweth he hath done. Howbeit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we proceede any further to confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:2586:170"/>of the ground, why this Metaphor ſhould be counted ſo apt, and ſo much to this purpoſe delighted in; we are firſt to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſt and that by the belly, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence theſe riuers of water of life ſhoulde flowe, is meant the ſoule, heart, and good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence by faith purified, in the beleeuers, <hi>Actes</hi> 15. <hi>Ver.</hi> 9. For the end of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, and ſo the ſhew of all the good fruites of the Spirit in Gods children, <hi>commeth from a pure conſcience, and both them from faith vnfained,</hi> as <hi>Paule</hi> teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. <hi>Ver.</hi> 5. The bellie and bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els are no ſeate or fountaine, from whence ſuch things iſſue or flowe. Then where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, the holy Ghoſt was not yet, whereof he telleth vs we are to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande Chriſtes promiſes; we muſt take heede that we vnderſtand not that, as ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the eſſence or being of the holy Ghoſt, leaſt we fall into the heriſie of the <hi>Nacedonians,</hi> who denied the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heade of the holy Ghoſt: for ſo he hath beene from euerlaſting, according to our catholike faith, God coetarnall and coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall with the Father and the Sonne. And therefore the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> ſpeakeing ſo ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ſaith, <hi>by the word of God were the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nens made, and by the ſpirit of his mouth
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:2586:170"/>all the powers thereof. Pſal.</hi> 33. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 6. And therefore our Creede &amp; Baptiſme binde vs aſwell to beleeue in the holy Ghoſt, as in GOD the Father, or in GOD the Sonne. And when Chriſt was baptized, as <hi>Math.</hi> teſtifieth that <hi>there was a voice hearde from Heauen from the Father, This is my welbeloued Sonne, in whome I am well pleaſed;</hi> ſo hee ſaith, that <hi>Iohn Baptiſt ſaw the Spirite of GOD deſcending like a Doue and lighting vpon him. Math.</hi> 3. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 16. <hi>&amp;</hi> 17. <hi>Iohn</hi> therefore muſt be vnderſtood to ſpeake thus, not of the eſſence or being of the holic Ghoſt, but of the giftes and graces thereof, in ſome fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meaſure, than as yet, when Chriſt made this promiſe, they had beene or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily giuen vnto them that belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in him. And I ſaide aduiſedly and of purpoſe thus: for it is moſt cleare and euident that before this, all the Saintes and ſeruantes of GOD, that beleeued in GOD, feared him and beleeued in him, had the Spirit of God and the giftes and graces thereof, in good meaſure, without which they could not haue done ſo as they did, ſo to do;
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:2586:171"/>being, as it is, the ſpeciall worke of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, as it is knowne well inough to be. And of <hi>Simeon</hi> doe we not reade in plaine tearmes, before this, that <hi>the holy Ghoſt was vpon him, and that a reuelation was giuen him of the holy Ghoſt, that hee ſhould not ſee death before he had ſeene the Lord Chriſt, and that he came by the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the spirit into the Temple, &amp;c. Luke</hi> 2.25. <hi>&amp;c?</hi> And in deede, by yeelding his reaſon of his ſpeach as he doth, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>for Ieſus was not yet glorified,</hi> he giueth vs to vnderſtand, that his ſpeach is to be but vnderſtood by way of compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, and not ſimply. And thus both <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt</hi> in his 32. Tract vpon <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome</hi> in his 50. Homile vpon this place before me expound it. For <hi>Auguſtine</hi> there, after that he had ſhewed that Chriſtes wordes can neither be vnderſtood of the eſſence of the holy Ghoſt, which hath beene with the Father from euerlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor yet ſimply of the giftes thereof, for that many both in the old Teſtament and new, as there he declareth, had good meaſure thereof; his determination is, that <hi>modus futurus erat dationis huius qui emnino antea non apparuerat,</hi> that is, that yet there ſhould be a manner of giuing
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:2586:171"/>thereof, which was ueuer ſeene before, whereof this is ſpoken, ſaith hee. And the other in the foreſaide place of his, moſt plainly expoundeth, the Riuers of water of life, <hi>largiorem ſpiritus gratiam,</hi> more large grace of the Spirit than was giuen before. And therefore alſo, both of them there ſhewe that by the Belly we are to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, the heart and conſcience of the inward man, anſwerable to the inwarde drinke and thirſt ſpoken of here by Chriſt. And ſo often in the olde Teſtament, the Prophets hauing an eye to the wonderfull meaſure of Gods grace and plentifulnes of Gods ſpirit, that ſhould be powredour, vpon the Church the Meſſias being come, though in very deede they ſpeake but by compariſon, and ſo of neceſſitie muſt be vnderſtoode (for elſewhere very plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they ſhewe that the ſpirit of God was in good meaſure vpon them ſelues and vpon others then) yet they vtter the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God touching his powring out of his Spirit then, as though it were a new thing, that hee had neuer done before: as you may ſee and beholde in the 44. of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay,</hi> and in the 2. of <hi>Ioell</hi> in the places before alleaged. And thus alſo muſt Chriſtes owne ſaying, <hi>Iohn</hi> 16.7. of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:2586:172"/>be vnderſtoode, <hi>it is expedient for you that I goe away: for if I goe not away, the Comforter will not come vnto you; but if I depart I will ſend him vnto you:</hi> for before that, it appeareth they beleeued in him to whome he ſo ſpake <hi>Iohn.</hi> 6.69. For there <hi>Peter</hi> in all their names ſaith, <hi>we beleeue and know that thou art the Sonne of the liuing God,</hi> which is a fruite of the Spirit. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22. And before his aſcention and glorification it was, that he breathed vpon them and ſaide, <hi>receiue yee the holie Ghoſt. Iohn.</hi> 20.22: wherefore, before in ſome meaſure the Comforter was giuen them. Indeede after his aſcention, as we may ſee, he ſhewed himſelfe mindfull of his promiſe to the full, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. in furniſhing them ſo vpon the ſudden, with all giftes meete for their calling, as <hi>that they were filled with the holy Ghoſt, and Spake with other tongues as the Spirit gaue them vtterance.</hi> If any be now deſirous to know why this plentifull and moſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refull furniſhing of his with ſuch giftes &amp; graces from aboue, was reſerued to follow as a fruite, effect, and conſequent of his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cention, and glorification; let him vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that in the infinite wiſdome and prouidence of GOD it was, that ſo it
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:2586:172"/>might be made manifeſt vnto his Church, to begette in the ſame a ſtronge and liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hope; that as by his humiliation and abaſemente he had obtained and purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for it eternall redemption, ſo now by his exaltation and aduancemente, he was ſo ſetled at the right hande of his Father, that he was able to poure downe vpon the ſame, all giftes and graces ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie to the effectuall applying and ſealing the ſame thereunto. So that thenceforth none neede doubte but that he hath gone through with the worke of our redemption and ſaluation, and that as heade and huſband ouer his Church, he can and will guide, decke, and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the ſame with all the rich treaſures of the graces of GOD, which dwell and reſt in him as in the fountaine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yonde all meaſure, that of his ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing and infinite fullnes, euery mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thereof might receiue inough, to bring it to perfection in him; as moſt notably <hi>Paule</hi> teacheth, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 9. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But yet neither Chriſt, nor <hi>Iohn</hi> heere are ſo to bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode, as though this promiſe of Chriſt heere were limited and to bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended noe further than to thoſe,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:2586:173"/>vpon whom after his aſſention in that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary manner he beſtowed his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite &amp; the giftes thereof, though I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but thinke they had an eſpeciall and firſt eye vnto them, as vnto the firſt fruites of all the reſt that ſhoulde follow. For doubtles as Chriſt requireth all, that he ſpake of before, that thirſt to come vnto him to drinke and to beleeue in him, as ſaith the Scripture, and therefore lookes for all this at the handes of euery true member of his myſticall bodie the church: ſo the thing promiſed appertaineth and is common to them all, though according to the diuerſitie of places that they hold in that bodie, one and the ſelfe ame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is diuerſly beſtowed vpon them, as we are taught 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. <hi>Ver.</hi> 4. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that the Spirit and the giftes and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God, are here ſo promiſed to them all, and ſhalbe and are performed, as that aptly they may be called riuers of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of life flowring out of their bellies. But yet then ſome may maruaile, comparing the ſpirit and giftes thereof ſeene in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the faithfull, ſince Chriſt was glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, with the Spirit and giftes thereof founde in ſundry, as in the Patriarches and Prophets and other famous holy men in
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:2586:173"/>the olde Teſtament, and finding them in ſhow to be but equall, or rather inferiour to ſome of theirs, why <hi>Iohn</hi> ſhoulde ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſimply or by waie of compariſon, thus ſignifie vnto vs that the Spirite had not beene giuen in ſuch meaſure before, as nowe Chriſt beeing glorified it ſhould. Whereunto though I might anſwere that <hi>Iohn</hi> might well ſay ſo, in that then the partition wall betwixt Iew and Gentile ſhoulde be pulled downe, and ſo the borders &amp; compaſſe of the Church ſhould wonderfully be enlarged, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they were before: yet more fullie to aunſwere this obiection, though in reſpect of thoſe times wherein the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarches and Prophets and holie men of GOD liued, in the time of the olde Teſtament, their faith and other fruites of the Spirite that appeared and were founde in them, were verie commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yet in many reſpectes <hi>Iohn</hi> might preferre the Spirite and the giftes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of giuen to beleeuers in the newe Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament ſo before them in the olde, that in compariſon thereof, the Spirite might be ſaide not to haue beene before. For firſt, though then the myſteries of religion were ſufficientlie reuealed for
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:2586:174"/>thoſe times; yet were they not opened ſo clearely and lightſomely then, as now ſince the comming of Chriſt: and the Spirit that, he beeing aſcended, he promiſeth to his, leadeth them to all trueth and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them all thinges, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 14.26. In ſo much that the beleeuing Chriſtian nowe can ſpeake by direction therof, more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Trinitie, of Chriſtes perſon and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and of many other myſteries of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian religion, than any of them had done or could. In reſpect and regard whereof, Chriſt ſaith of <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> verily verily amongſt them that are begotten of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, aroſe there not a greater: and yet notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding he that is leaſt in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God is greater than he. For he preached Chriſt, and pointed him preſent, and none of them ſawe him or ſpake of him but a farre off; and yet after Chriſt had gone thorow with that which he came for, and was aſcended; by his Spirite he ſo enlighteneth the heartes of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt ſounde members of his Church, that they can ſay more of him than <hi>Iohn</hi> coulde. And in this reſpect Chriſt ſaide, that manie Kings and Prophets had deſired to ſee and heare thoſe thinges which his Apoſtles and followers ſawe,
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:2586:174"/>and yet did not, <hi>Luke.</hi> 10.24. Then who alſo knoweth not that the miniſtrie and reuelation of the will of God was then verie darke, it lay ſo much in types and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, in compaſſon that it is now, Chriſt being come and aſcended, at whom thoſe did but aime and poynte at a farre off; and that therefore in that reſpect, <hi>Paule</hi> might truely and iuſtly ſay, <hi>that the night was paſt and the day come, Rom.</hi> 13.12. and alſo magnifie the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie of the newe Teſtament, as <hi>farre more glorious than that of the olde,</hi> as moſt notablie he doth, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. <hi>&amp;c?</hi> For then they had but the light of the moone and the ſtarres to direct them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as we nowe haue the brightneſſe of the ſhining ſonne; and theirs in compariſon <hi>was but of the letter and of death, and ours is of the ſpirite &amp; of life,</hi> as <hi>Paule</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth there. And therefore how can it be otherwiſe, but that the effectes and fruits of the Spirite beeing conformable in ſome good meaſure to the miniſtry wherby it worketh, but that now ſince his comming and glorification they ſhoulde be in his as riuers of water of life, flowing out of their bellies; whereas before they were in compariſon but like vnto the little
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:2586:175"/>and ſoft running water from out of the fountaine of <hi>Siloah</hi> at the foote of the mount <hi>Syon.</hi> And ſomewhat it maketh the better to make vs vnderſtande both what Chriſt ſaide and did, as <hi>Iohn</hi> heere hath ſet it down, that <hi>Tremelius</hi> noteth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this place. For he telleth vs that the Iewes in their Talmud in the tract of the feaſt of Tabernacles <hi>Chapter Chal.</hi> ſhewe that the laſt day of that feaſt was the greateſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as they ſay, their ancient Doctors taught them that whereas the other daies thereof, they ſhoulde in ioy onely once circuit the Altar carrying boughes and palmes in their handes, and crying <hi>Hoſannah,</hi> that is, ſaue I pray, this laſt day by tradition, as they tooke it from <hi>Haggai</hi> and <hi>Zachariah,</hi> they were ſo to doe ſeauen times, crying both <hi>Hoſannah</hi> and <hi>Hatzlicannah,</hi> (that is, ſaue vs I pray thee, and make vs to proſper) oftentimes with a lowde voyce: and further he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth that there it is ſet downe as the faſhion of that people receiued by the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition (as they tooke it) from the ſame Prophets, that that day they vſed with greate ioy to drawe water out of the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of <hi>Syloach,</hi> and to carry it to the Prieſtes, that they might powre it vpon
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:2586:175"/>the Altar with the drinke offering of wine, hauing in the meane time that ſonge cheerefully &amp; alowde, which we read, <hi>Eſay.</hi> 12.3. <hi>You ſhall drawe waters with ioy out of the fountaine of ſaluation:</hi> which whiles they did, they thought they ſerued God highly, and prouoked him to beſtow the Spirit of propheſie vpon them, as ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitiouſly they dreamed that he did v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon <hi>Ionas</hi> whiles he was ſo occupied. Whereupon (as he thinketh) it might well be that Ieſus tooke occaſion, as that day ſtanding (whereas otherwiſe when he taught, he vſed to ſit and to ſpeake but in an ordinarie voyce) to cry vnto them, that ſo the better, for all that noyſe and ſtirre, he might be heard of them, <hi>If any man thirſt, let him come vnto me and drinke: he that beleeueth in me (as ſaith the ſcripture) out of his belly ſhall flowe riuers of water of life:</hi> ſo to draw them from that ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious faſhion, indeede to drawe water of life out of him, <hi>the fountaine of liuing wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> as he is termed, <hi>Iere.</hi> 2.3. All theſe things therefore now thus laide and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered togither, I hope you vnderſtand both Chriſt and <hi>Iohn</hi> in theſe wordes of my text, and perceiue what other occaſion ſoeuer he had, he had heerein a purpoſe to
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:2586:176"/>promiſe them that directly come vnto him, by drinking of him to ſatisfie their thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie ſoules, and that leauing running to all other rotten ceſternes that could holde no water, they ſhould finde him no drie fountaine, but a fountaine to fill them, ſo that they ſhoulde runne ouer againe therwith to the watering of others: and beſides you ſee that the Lord hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies taken a delight thus to ſpeake of the ſpirite and giftes thereof, that they ſhoulde receiue that would onelie ſeeke to come to the Father by him.</p>
            <p>Wherefore ſeeing the ground of ſuch metaphoricall ſpeeches is alwaies the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude and reſemblance (as once I haue ſaid alreadie) betwixt the metaphore and the thinges metaphorized;
<note place="margin">The right vſe and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the promiſe.</note> let vs ſee and viewe what likelihoode there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt riuers of waterof life flowing out of ones bellie, and the giftes and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Gods ſpirite promiſed to them that thus come vnto Chriſt and beleeue in him. Marke therefore amongeſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie other properties that water hath, it hath theſe ſoure; that is, firſt to waſh and make cleane; then to ſoften and molli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie; and next to make fruitfull that which otherwiſe would be barren; and laſtly to
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:2586:176"/>quench and coole. For as you knowe cloathes and other thinges a number, are waſhed and made cleane thereby: the earth that otherwiſe woulde be as Braſſe and Iron vnder vs, is ſoftened and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, it falling vpon it in due ſeaſon and manner, it is made fruitefull alſo; and thereby likewiſe we ſee fire quenched, and heate much cooled and abated. Wherefore in that Chriſt promiſeth his ſpirite vnto thoſe that thus come vnto him, and make him theirs by belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in him, vnder the name of waters; thus much, to beginne withall (vnleſſe we might thinke that he coulde not tell howe to ſpeake aptly, which but to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine were abſurd,) euen hereby we are taught, that the ſpirite of God in ſuch muſt and will be as water, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of power to waſh and make them cleane of the ſoule errours and ſinnes, wherewith before they were defiled: and ſo alſo of power to ſoften their ſtonie and harde heartes, that the ſeede of the worde may ſinke deepe inough therein, and to make them bring forth fruite alwaies in due ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and finally likewiſe it will ſhew it ſelfe of force to quench in them the fire
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:2586:177"/>of concupiſcence and to abate the heate of all other ſinne. Let not any man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore flatter himſelfe, and thinke he hath done what heere Chriſt commaunded, vnleſſe he can approoue it by the bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and dwelling of the ſpirite in him, in that ſorte and meaſure, that it may worthilie beare the name of water in all theſe reſpectes. For Chriſt was and is of infinite power and wiſedome, and therefore we may be ſure he hath made heere no other promiſe, but that which he both can and will performe. Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lacke of abilitie to be as good as his worde, nor raſhneſſe or vnaduiſedneſſe in paſſing of it at any time, was euer found in him: wherefore let vs not be behind in performing the commaundement, and nothing is more certaine than that he will not be behinde with vs in performing of his promiſe. If therefore we finde our hearts and liues ſtill delighted with our old filthie errours and ſinnes, ſtonie and ſlinty that the worde can take no roote in, or that cannot tremble at the judgementes of God, barren of all goodneſſe, and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſtill with luſt, and on heate with, and after other ſinnes: then whatſoeuer we can prate or talke of Chriſt, or faith in him
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:2586:177"/>as yet we are meere ſtrangers from them both. Without figure or Metaphor that you may ſee the plaine euidence thereof, marke (I beſeech you) but amongſt infinite o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, theſe moſt plame teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Scripture concerning this point. <hi>The fruite of the ſtirit it in al goodnes, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes and truth Epheſ</hi> 5. <hi>Ver.</hi> 9. <hi>They that are in Chriſt, and ſo partakers of his death and reſurrection, they muſt be, and are ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by and by the power of his ſpirit, deade to ſinne &amp; aliue to righteouſnes, Rom.</hi> 6. <hi>Ver.</hi> 3. <hi>&amp;c.

Whereby it is moſt euident, whatſoeuer we haue beene before, when once we are come to Chriſt and haue pur on him, the caſe muſt be ſo quite changed and altered with vs, that then though <hi>Paule</hi> may ſay of vs, <hi>you were once ſuch and ſuch,</hi> yet now he may haue cauſe to ſay, as he ſaide in the like caſe of the <hi>Corinthians; but yee are waſhed, but yee are ſanctified, but yee are iuſtified, in the name of the Lord Ieſus, and by the ſpirit of our God.</hi> For <hi>Dauid</hi> can ſay, hauing an eie to Chriſt then far off, <hi>purge me with Hiſop, and I shall be cleane, waſh me and I shall be whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than ſnow, Pſal.</hi> 51. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 7. How then may we doe that diſhonour vnto Chriſt being come, as either to think that we are waſhed in his bloode and ſo iuſtified, and yet remaine ſtill foule &amp; filthie, or hauing ſeemed to be clenſed and eſcaped from the filthines of the world, through the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our Lord &amp; Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:2586:178"/>to ſuffer our ſelues to be tangled and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come therewith againe? If we ſhould thus doe, we doe him the greateſt diſhonour &amp; diſcredit that we can. For what cleanly lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe would not take it to be a ſhame vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hir, to be ſaid or thought to haue waſht her clothes, they remaining ſtill as foule &amp; filthy as euer they were? And moſt certaine it is, if hauing put our hand to the plow, we looke back againe, we are, by Chriſts owne ſentence alreadie pronounced vpon vs, not meete for the kindom of heauen, <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.62. and if we be backſliders and reuolters, Saint <hi>Peter</hi> hath told vs what we may truſt to, namely that then our latter end ſhal be worſe than our beginning; yea that we are no better than dogs, turned to our vomit, or than ſowes, after they are waſht, retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the wallowing in the mire, 2. <hi>Epiſt. Cap.</hi> 3.20. And moſt ſeareful is that which we read, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4. <hi>&amp;c. &amp;</hi> 10.26. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing apoſtataes &amp; reuolters from the faith: for there ſuch are told that it is impoſſible that they ſhould be renewed againe by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, that there is no more ſacrifice to be offred for their ſins, that there is nothing left for them but a fearefull expectation of irreuocable iudgment and condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now doubtles the verie waye
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:2586:179"/>and means to come to this dreadfull eſtate is, for them that haue ſeemed to ſtand by profeſſing once the ſounde faith, to be careleſſe in maintaining and preſeruing conſcience in their liues and conuerſation; and therefore to teach vs aſmuch <hi>Paul.</hi> calles vpon his <hi>Timothie,</hi> to maintaine and nouriſh togither, faith and a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, for that whiles ſome (as namely <hi>Hymineus</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi>) haue made no carefull reckoning of the one, they haue made ſhipwracke of the other. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.19. <hi>&amp;</hi> 20. Let him therefore that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to ſtande, take heede he fall not. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.12. and in anie caſe alſo let him that would ſeeme to be in deede in Chriſt Ieſus, be a new creature. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. for ſuch haue crucified the fleſh with the affections and luſtes thereof. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.24. they walke not after the fleſh, but after the Spirit, (as ye haue heard) <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. and they are a people zealous of good workes. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14. Wherefore let vs ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer once thinke that our ſinnes are in Chriſt Ieſus couered, vnleſſe we finde our ſelues cured thereof; or that for his ſake they are pardoned, vnleſſe we in truth perceiue our bodies and ſoules pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged at the leaſt thereof, that ſinne raigne
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:2586:179"/>not in our mortall bodies <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.12. For they that ſo are of God, <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith flatly, they cannot ſinne (meaning, ſo as that ſinne raigne in them) for that they are borne of God, and his ſeede remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in them. 3.9. Howſoeuer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Hypocrites, and ſuch as haue but a temporarie faith, may and often doe fall headlong into obeying ſinne with their full and whole conſent as their lawfull king, in whoſe obedience willingly they take delight, and ſo ſuch worthily quite leaſe thoſe giftes and good graces, which they ſeamed to haue before and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently by their ſo falling away, as the ſame <hi>Iohn</hi> teacheth in the former Chapter <hi>Cap.</hi> 2. <hi>Ver.</hi> 10. make it euident, that they were neuer of the number indeede, that by a liuelie faith were in Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus; for then as he ſaith, they would ſtill haue continued with ſuch: yet ſo it is neither finally, nor at any time after, with thoſe that once haue vnfainedly and right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly indeede put on Chriſt. For as <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth moſt euidently and forciblie <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. throughout, and <hi>Col.</hi> 1.2. ſuch haue ſo put him on and are in him, that as he once for all died and was buried to put away their ſinne, and roſe againe, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:2586:180"/>into heauen, and ſitteth there at the right hand of the father, to confer &amp; beſtowe vpon them a perfect righteouſnes &amp; iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſo by the power and efficacie of Chriſt dwelling in them, they are deade to ſinne, and aliue to righteouſnes: and therefore, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer, will they nill they, they may, by ſome reliques of ſinne remaining in them to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble them and to wraſtle againſt, be inforced with the ſame Apoſtle in the next chapter, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaining of the tyranny of ſinne, to cry out, <hi>I do not that good I would, but that which I hate that doe I,</hi> yet all ſuch with a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, may comfort themſelues againe with him, and ſay, <hi>if I doe that I would not doe, and hate, it is not I that doe it, but ſinne that dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in mee, Cap.</hi> 6.15. <hi>&amp;</hi> 20. And in the end they may be ſure, that the ſpirit that dwelleth in them, will ſo ſtrenthen them againſt the fleſh, that they ſhall get in the end of the battle, the victorie, and that in the meane time, the fleſh ſhall neuer be able vtterly to preuaile: as they may reade, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. <hi>&amp;.</hi> 24. For that Spirit being once com into thefield, though old <hi>Ada<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> muſter all his beaten &amp; wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſouldiers neuer ſo oft; yet that man in whoſe hart the field is once pitched &amp; fought, may aſſure him ſelfe, that it is as abſurd for him to think that either in the end or at any
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:2586:180"/>time, the fleſh ſhall preuaile to driue that ſpirit out of the field; as it is to thinke that a baſe creature can ouercome God the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. And to aſſure all ſuch hereof, Chriſt hath promiſed when he ſends once this Spirit of his vnto them, that it ſhal be their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mforter, &amp; that it ſhal abide with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for euer. <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.16. &amp; that he would beg of his father, that he ſhoulde ſo doe. And therfore they may be ſure, that he hath done it, &amp; hath alſo obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his ſute; for he is truth it ſelfe. <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.6. &amp; therfore true in his promiſe, &amp; beſids he tels vs, that he knew his father alwaies heard him. <hi>Iohn</hi> 11.42. Let not that wrong therfor be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred either to Chriſt, or to his Spirit, that any ſhould but once think that either of theſe can be driuen out of poſſeſſion, after once they haue taken it in theirs, either by Sathan, the world, or the fleſh: they may be buſy to grieue &amp; trouble them, but neuer ſhal they preuaile: for they are alwayes the ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerin finitely, and their loue &amp; care to keep &amp; preſerue theirs is like them ſelues, that is eternal &amp; moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant: &amp; indeed, in that Chriſt here in our text promiſeth his ſpirite not only in &amp; vnder the name of water, but of riuers of waters, &amp; that of life, flowing out of their bellies, that ſhould doe, as before he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded; al this being to be vnderſtood of the giftes &amp; graces of the ſpirit, which he would beſtow vpon all ſuch
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:2586:181"/>(as we haue heard;) as thereby we are taught that he will giue them to ſuch, not in a ſcant, but in a very plentious manner and meaſure, for that he is a liberall giuer, <hi>Iames</hi> 1.5, ſo by calling them Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of the water of life, he teacheth vs and aſſureth vs that they will neuer alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither die, or be dried vp: for his giftes giuen to ſuch, are without repentance <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.29. They ſhew alſo by the other addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of flowing out of their bollies, that they will not be ſmothered and kept in within the bellies of the beleeuers owne ſelfe, whatſoeuer the ſtate of the time be wherein hee liues. For they muſt flow out of their bellies; and therefore ſuch muſt let their light ſhine be fore men, to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of God, and good example and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of others, as Chriſt hath taught them <hi>Math.</hi> 5.16. Wherefore let the firſt of theſe leſſons occaſion euery one that is deſirous to haue any comfortable aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that this promiſe is made to him &amp; appertaineth vnto him, to ſtriue by al law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and good meanes, to haue the ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying giftes of the ſpirit, in ſuch plentifull and abundant meaſure in him, that he may feele, and others finde by experience, that they may worthily be compared to
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:2586:181"/>riuers of water. And by the ſecond let eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſuch one alſo learne for the better certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of his owne heart, that he is ſuch an one indeed, that he muſt perſeuere vnto the end, <hi>Math.</hi> 10.22. euermore brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging forth more fruite in hir age, as the tree planted in the houſe of God whereunto ſuch are compared, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92.13.14. vſeth to doe. For to the vnſpeakable comfort of all ſuch, the giftes and graces of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpirit vndoubtedly accompanying their right comming vnto Chriſt, and belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in him, are heere reſembled vnto ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of waters of life, not onely for that they come from the true fountaine of life, and will leade and guide the owner therof therunto, but alſo for that in ſuch in whom they are once founde, they will neuer ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wholly or finally faile or drie vp. As therefore ſuch may be ſure that the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of God remaineth ſure, <hi>The Lorde knoweth who are his,</hi> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. ſo they may be by theſe fruites of the Spirit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hypocrifie founde in them, moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that according to Saint <hi>Peters</hi> coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell they haue ioyned vertue to their faith, and ſo conſequently haue made their own election ſo ſure vnto themſelues (which
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:2586:182"/>alwaies before was ſure with God) as that they ſhall neuer fall. For this is the indiſſoluble chaine of God, whereof one linke can neuer at all be ſeuered or ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred from an other after that but once the firſt two be coupled, whom he knewe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and predeſtinated to be like to the image of his Sonne, and ſo elected in him before the foundations of the world, thoſe he firſt calleth, then iuſtifieth, then ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth, and laſtly glorifieth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29.30. <hi>Ephe.</hi> 1.4. Whom therfore indeed we finde once by theſe riuers of waters of life ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, we may be out of doubt that the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God hath elected, called, and iuſtified, and that alſo them he wil glorifie. For this ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpirit beareth witnes with their ſpirits, that they are the children of God, and ſo imboldneth them to cal vpon him ſaying, <hi>Abba Father, Rom.</hi> 8.15.16. and it is the holy Spirite of promiſe that ſealeth them and is the earneſt of their inheritance and redemption in Chriſt Ieſus, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 1.13.14. Though therefore ſuch to their own ſence and feeling, and perhaps alſo in the conceit of others, may haue not onely theſe graces of the Spirite more eclipſed at one time than at another, yea may thinke that they
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:2586:182"/>are quite dried vp and vaniſhed: yet foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as whom God once loues, (as doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleſſe he doth all them whom once truely he doth thus qualifie he) loues to the end <hi>Iohn.</hi> 13.1; let all ſuch be moſt firmelie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued that this is but the better to humble them, and to prouoke them, when they finde theſe graces reuiued in them againe, to worke out their owne ſaluation with the more trembling and feare, becauſe he that hath begunne this good work in them, will neuer giue it ouer vntill he haue brought it to perfection; and he it is that will worke in them both the will and the deede of his good pleaſure. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2.12.13. For ſuch haue the infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible markes of Chriſtes elect and cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen ſheepe, whereof he himſelfe moſt plainelie teacheth, that it is impoſſible that any ſhoulde eyther take them out of his handes, or that any of them ſhould finallie periſh. <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.24. and <hi>Iohn.</hi> 10.28. The reaſon is, that they are kept by the power of God through faith, to ſaluation. 1. <hi>Peter.</hi> 1.5. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede meete it is and verie needefull, that ſuch that once haue attained to the graces &amp; giftes of the Spirit, to be as riuers
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:2586:183"/>of waters of life in them that they ſhould doe what they may poſſiblie to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh and increaſe the ſame, and they are to knowe that if they doe fayle in doing of their duetie in this behalfe, that they are worthilie cauſed to ſee and feele to the greate griefe of their ſoules, the decaye thereof; yea that they haue done as much as lies in them, vtterly to leaſe them and to prouoke GOD to be their enemie: and therefore they are moſt earneſtlie to repente their negligence and careleſneſſe in this pointe. But yet the force of this Metaphore, theſe places and a number moe in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that are as pregnant to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, moſt plainely ſhowe that when thus it falles out with ſuch, that yet in the goodneſſe of GOD towardes them this their ſence, feeling, and the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of others prooue no ſtronglier that theſe giftes of the Spirite are quite gone in them indeede, than the eclipſing or hiding away of the ſunne from our eies by foggie miſtes or cloudes at noone daies, the raking vp of the fire when there is ſtore thereof in the aſhes, the not ſtirring of a liue and ſtrong childe
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:2586:183"/>in the mothers wombe at all times a like, or the not appearing of leaues and fruite vpon quicke trees in an orcharde in the deepe of winter, proue that there is no Sunne in the firmament, no fyre on the harth, no childe in the wombe, or that then there is no ſappe in the roote of the trees. As therefore when neyther the moone, fogges, nor cloudes are betwixt vs and the Sunne, it will appeare and ſhine againe; as when the aſhes are remoued, and the coles hid thereunder are blowne againe, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of may growe as greate a fire as euer before; as when the childe ſtirreth againe, though it haue life without motion a greate while before, the mother con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth as certaine hope that ſhe is with childe as euer before; and as when the ſpring time commeth, there will be both leaues and fruite vpon the trees in the orchard that ſeemed deade be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the winter: ſo is it in this caſe, when GOD ſhall remooue the lettes and cauſes (as moſt certainelie he will aſwell in this, as in theſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we ſee naturallie and common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie they are) then the brightneſſe, heat,
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:2586:184"/>motion and liuelineſſe of his Spirite, ſhall and will in his appeare againe.</p>
            <p>But then the better and the more eaſilie that they may finde this to be thus, laſtly I woulde haue all ſuch to remember that it is not inough that to their owne ſence, and in their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceites they haue theſe giftes of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit as riuers of waters of life: but that if they be ſuch indeede as heere are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, and therfore are performed to all that come vnto Chriſt and beleeue in him, that they muſt flowe out of their bellies. Where by their bellies, we are to vnderſtand, as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> hath well noted in his 32. tract vpon <hi>Iohn,</hi> the bellie of the inner man, which, as he there telles vs, is the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience of the heart. And as there alſo he ſaith, this flowing of riuers of water out of the bellie of the inner man <hi>Beneuolentia eius eſt qua vult conſulere proximo: ſi enim pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tet quia quod bibit ſoli ipſi debet ſuffice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, non fluit aqua viua de ventre eius; ſi autem proximo feſtinet conſulere, ideo non ſiccat quia manat:</hi> that is, Is his bountifulneſſe wherewith he will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for the good of his neighbour: for
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:2586:184"/>if he thinke that that which hee hath drunke muſt but ſerue himſelfe, the water of life flowes not out of his bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie; but if he make haſt to doe good to his neighbour, it drieth not vp, and that becauſe it floweth. For as Chriſt hath taught vs by the parable of the Talents, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.4. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in no caſe we may conceale or hide the Talentes that he beſtowes vpon vs, but vſe them we muſt to his beſt aduantage; for otherwiſe they ſhall bee quite taken from vs: whereas if we laye them forth, and vſe them to the gaine of him that beſtowed them, they ſhall not onelie be increaſed, but in the ende we ſhall haue a moſte comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table rewarde. <hi>Pſeudonicodemits</hi> then, whatſoeuer the time and place bee where and when we liue, wee may at no hande bee: that is, for feare of the Iewes or Phariſies, we may not be ſuch as dare with <hi>Nichode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> come ſtealinge to Chriſt by night onelie, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 3.1. For Chriſt moſte plainelie hath tolde vs, <hi>Mark.</hi> 8.38. <hi>That whoſoeuer he bee that will be aſhamed of him and of his
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:2586:185"/>wordes amongeſt an adulterous and ſinne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full generation, he will be aſhamed of him in the glorie of his Father.</hi> As therfore we beleeue with the heart to righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſo Saint <hi>Paule</hi> teacheth vs, that <hi>we muſt confeſſe with our mouthes to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, Rom.</hi> 10.10. For where true and liuelie faith is indeede, there it wil make her owner to be at the ſame pointe that the Pſalmiſt was, whatſoeuer come of it, when he ſaide, <hi>I beleeued, and therefore haue</hi> I <hi>ſpoken, Pſal.</hi> 116.10. And likewiſe where true faith is, as it worketh immediatelie with GOD in heauen, for the iuſtification of her ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, through Chriſt Ieſus, ſo ſtreight alſo, and ſo thenceforth it ſetteth the heart of her owner ſo on fire with loue both towardes God, that in his Chriſt hath ſo tenderly loued him, and towardes man for his ſake, that thence he is moſt carefull that ſuch workes and wordes may flowe as both ſhall and may giue a liuelie teſtimonie thereof both to God &amp; man. For all ſuch haue with Saint <hi>Paule</hi> learned, <hi>that by Chriſt they are redeemed from all iniquitie, and purged to be a peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er people vnto himſelfe, zealous of good
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:2586:185"/>workes. Tit.</hi> 2.14. Thus if theſe riuers of waters of life flow out of our bellies, then, and not elſe, we may be ſure we are come vnto Chriſt, and haue drunke of him to eternall life. Whiles then we teach thus (as no otherwiſe wee doe,) doe we ſet open any gappe of libertie or licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes to our hearers, or are we in our doctrine any way enimies to good works, as our aduerſaries ſlander vs? Nay doe we not as earneſtly and vehemently, as they can for their liues, vrge men to doe them? Indeede we dare not teach them, when they haue done neuer ſo manie of them, in any caſe to make any peece of a ſauiour, eyther of any thing they doe or ſuffer: becauſe, as you haue heard, we learned out of the Scriptures, that that office ſo intirely and wholly is to be referred to Chriſt, that it may not be imparted or communicated, without an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian robbing of him of that ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all honour that belongs vnto him, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie thing or perſon elſe. But yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, as now you heare, we moſt plainely teach, that none can haue any certaintie in himſelfe (without which our faith is but a fruiteles wauering con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:2586:186"/>that as yet he is in Chriſt and ſhall be ſaued vndoubtedlie for his ſake, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the power of him dwelling in him, truelie appeare by theſe fruites of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, that are heere for their puritie, multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie, vtilitie, and continuance called ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of water of life flowing out of the bellies of ſuch. And therefore though we dare not with our aduerſaries teach men, nor encourage men to doe good workes, either in part or in whole to earne, deſerue, or merit heauen by, (which vnleſſe we would ſay with them, we ſay nothing to this purpoſe) yet moſt cleare and eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent it is, that to that end we vſe and vrge all the arguments that the Scriptures haue taught vs. For we beſeech them <hi>by the mercies of God</hi> with Paule. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1. <hi>to giue vp their bodies a liuing ſacrifice, holy and acceptable vnto God, in ſeruing him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his word, and not according to the faſhions of the world.</hi> For that by theſe ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der mercies of God towardes vs in Chriſt Ieſus, we that beleeue aright in him, <hi>are deliuered out of the hands of all our enemies, that we ſhould ſerue him without feare, all the daies of our life, in holineſſe and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe before him. Luke.</hi> 1.74.75. For in
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:2586:186"/>that this <hi>grace of God, that bringeth ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vnto all men, hath appeared, it teacheth vs that we ſhould denie vngodlines &amp; worldly luſts, &amp; that we ſhould liue ſoberly, &amp; righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly &amp; godly in this preſent world. Tit.</hi> 2.11.12. Yea hauing rightlie laid hold of this grace, we ſay againe with the ſame <hi>Paule, That we are Gods workemanſhip created in Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus vnto good workes, which he hath ordained that we ſhoulde walke in Epheſ.</hi> 2.10. Againe with Chriſt to this ende we ſay vnto all, <hi>Let your light ſo ſhine before men, that they may ſee your good workes and glorifie your Father which is in heauen. Matth.</hi> 5.16. <hi>and loue one another, as he hath loued vs: for by this ſhall all men knowe, that yee are his Diſciples, Iohn.</hi> 13.34.36. And with <hi>Peter, we exhorte all men to ioyne vertue to their faith, to their vertue knowledge, to their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge temperance, to their temperance, patience, to their patience godlineſſe, and to that botherlie kindeneſſe and loue, ſo to make their election ſure,</hi> 2. <hi>Peter.</hi> 1.5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6. With <hi>Iames</hi> alſo we crie and call vpon euerie one that maketh confeſſion of faith, <hi>to ſhewe his faith by his workes,</hi> which if hee doe not,
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:2586:187"/>we as plainely tell him with the ſame <hi>Iames, that his faith is deade in himſelfe. Iam.</hi> 2.17. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For the faith that auai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in Chriſt Ieſus, as <hi>Paul</hi> hath taught vs, <hi>worketh by loue,</hi> not that loue is in the forme of faith (for how can one diſtinct vertue be the forme of an other) but that it is the inſeperable companion of a liuely and ſound faith. Neither are we negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in often laying before our people Gods law and the true meaning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, both to teach them what good workes are, and to incite them to doe the ſame. Wherein we dare be bould to ſay we goe beyond our aduerſaries, in leading men aright to good workes. For we vrge and ſhewe the lawe of GOD to be ſo perfect and abſolute a rule of good workes, that it reacheth to the condemning of the firſt motions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing in our mindes to ſinne, though they be not at all yeelded vnto and liked of, for that it calleth for the whole heart to be occupied onely in the things that pleaſe GOD, and that all ſinne is condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned therein, and all vertue commended: whereas our aduerſaries the papiſtes, holde the lawe to be ſo imperfect, that
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:2586:187"/>it condemneth not theſe firſt motions to ſinne, and that there are a number of good workes, and as meritorious, that haue for their grounde but the traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and commandements of men, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie that are expreſly commaunded by the law of GOD: forgetting belike that the law is ſo ſpirituall, that it made <hi>Paule</hi> to crie out of himſelfe, <hi>O wretched man that I am, who shall deliuer mee from this bodie of ſinne and death? Rom.</hi> 7.24. and that Chriſt moſt flatly hath ſaid, <hi>that they worship him in vaine that teach for doctrines mens preceptes. Math.</hi> 15.9. We vſe often to terrifie our hearers from ill workes, and from omitting of good, by making it manifeſt vnto them, by the iudgements of GOD therefore threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and executed, that ſo to doe, is ſo daingerous, as that thereby they deſerue all Gods heauie iudgments to be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vpon them both in this life, and in the life to come: and that vndoubtedlye they ſhall, if they repent not. Wherein alſo we goe further than theſe our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries: for they teach that a number of ſinnes, euen for the littlenes thereof, are not deadly, or ſuch as deſerue damnation,
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:2586:188"/>which may eaſily be ſatisfied for and put away. Laſtly we forget not to teach them what promiſes of reward God hath made to ſuch as will carefully walke before him in holineſſe and righteouſneſſe, both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this life, and that which to come; aſſuring them with <hi>Paule, That godlineſſe is profitable vnto all thinges, and hath the promiſe hoth of this life preſent, and of that which is to come.</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. wherein we goe ſo farre that alſo with Chriſt we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently tell them, that they <hi>ſhall not leaſe their rewarde in heauen, no not of a cup of colde water beſtowed aright in his name vpon any of his. Mat.</hi> 10.42. For though all that we doe or can doe, be infinitelie leſſe than we owe to God and are bound to doe, (<hi>for in many things we ſinne all, Iam.</hi> 3.2.) yet all that approue themſelues to be in Chriſt by walking not after the fleſh but after the ſpirite in bringing forth the right fruites thereof, as <hi>Paule</hi> teacheth <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.12.13. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> vndoubtedly for Gods promiſes ſake in Chriſt Ieſus, ſhall both heere and in heauen finde themſelues and their workes ſo liberally rewarded, that they ſhal haue no cauſe to complaine, but rather to wonder at Gods moſt boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:2586:188"/>crowning of his owne bleſſinges and graces with further both heere and there. Thus then you ſee that though, when the queſtion is in hande why men ſhall be ſaued, we dare ſende them to no other meritorious cauſe thereof but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to Chriſt, and the thinges done by himſelfe for vs, becauſe we know that <hi>his name is the one lie name whereby commeth ſaluation, Act.</hi> 4.12; yet when it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded who they are, which for Chriſtes ſake ſhall indeede be ſaued and ſo reſt in Gods tabernacle, and for euer dwell vpon his holy hill, we are boulde to teach that none but they that, according to the time and occaſion they haue after they be in him, proue themſelues to be ſuch by the riuers of water of life flowing out of their bellies, as you haue heard, and therefore are ſuch as are deſcribed to that ende, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 15.2. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And beeing ſuch, we counte it no preſumption, but moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable faith in them to be fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded (becauſe they haue not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Gods worde and promiſe generally offered vnto them, and particularly ſealed in the adminiſtration of the worde and Sacramentes outwardlie;
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:2586:189"/>but alſo moſt effectually inwardly teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnto their ſpirites by Gods owne Spirit by theſe newe fruites thereof, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine particularly vnto them, to ground this their perſwation vpon) that for Chriſtes ſake vndoubtedly they ſhal be ſaued. Theſe arguments therefore, we doubt not, will bee ſufficient to moue and to perſwade all that vnfainedly be the Lordes, euen of loue and thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes towardes him for his vnſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able loue and mercies towardes them, to ſtriue both day and night, by all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible meanes, ſo to ſtirre vp the graces of the ſpirit in them, that indeede wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thylie they may bee counted as Riuers of waters of life flowing out of their bellies.</p>
            <p>Thus then at laſt (welbeloued in the Lorde) we haue hearde firſt, the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of a notable ſermon made by Chriſt our Sauiour himſelfe, as where, when, vpon what occaſion, and in what manner he made it; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie at <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> in the temple, in and vpon the laſt and moſt ſolemne day of the feaſt of Tabernacles, to draw them that were there, from their owne vaine
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:2586:189"/>ſuperſtitions that led them from him to himſelfe, vttered by him ſtanding, and that with a crying voice. Secondly you haue heard that he ſpoke therein to all that be thirſtie, and to none elſe, that is to all that are truely broken and contrite hearted vnder the burthen of their ſinnes, and ſo earneſtly long for redemption and deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from the ſame. Thirdly you haue heard that he commaunded ſuch, what, to eaſe them of this their ſpirituall thirſt, they ſhoulde doe; and that that was, and is, firſt to come vnto him, that is to know and acknowledge him what he is in perſon and office, and then to drinke of him, that is, rightlie to beleeue in him, and ſo thereby to make him, with all the mercies of God prouided for mans ſaluation in him, their owne: which they hauing done, laſtly you haue heard that he promiſeth all ſuch that his Spirit in them all ſhould be as ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of water of life flowing out of their bellies, which was not, nor had not beene as yet then; becauſe when Chriſt made this ſermon, hee was not yet glorified. And in handling of all theſe, withall you haue beene ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what we are to learne euerie one of
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:2586:190"/>vs thereby, both miniſters and people, which haue beene ſuch and ſuch and ſo manie good thinges, as that if we haue heard as we ought to doe, we haue all of vs (I hope) euen ſufficiently to our ſaluation, learned both howe to beleeue and how to liue to be ſaued. For firſt we haue beene taught howe by the lawe we are to be humbled and throwne downe, that we may be fit patients for Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus ſecondly we haue heard by the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, how we are to riſe againe and to recouer a better ſtanding than euer we had in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> by knowledge and faith of the ſecond, Chriſt Ieſus our Lord and Sauiour. For we haue beene ſhewed how the Spirit of God by the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrie of the worde and Sacramentes through this faith of ours, grounded v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon ſounde knowledge, vnites Chriſt Ieſus himſelfe and vs togither, though after a ſpirituall manner, yet moſt truelie and effectually to our ſaluation, and the contrarie doctrine hath at large bene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed. And by the way it hath moſt plainely beene laide before vs, howe we ought to be qualified both in faith and manners, both in hearing of the
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:2586:190"/>worde and in the vſe of the Sacraments, that thereby ſtill we may growe vp in the houſe of GOD in Chriſt Ieſus to be perfect men, and acceptable in the ſight of his heauenlie father. Laſtlie, by the viewe of the promiſe we haue beene (I truſt) thorowlie taught what manner of liues we ought to leade, as long as we liue, after that once we bee got to be in Chriſt Ieſus indeede, in all true holineſſe and righteouſneſſe. God therefore of his infinite mercie for our Sauiour Chriſt Ieſus ſake giue vs grace ſo to imprint all theſe thinges in our harts, that to his owne glorie to the edifying of all others, amongeſt whom wee ſhall liue, and to the euerlaſting com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of our owne ſoules we may euerie one of vs that haue nowe hearde theſe thinges, both vnfainedlie beleeue and liue alwaies accordinglie. Nowe God the Father, God the Sonne, and God the holie Ghoſt, three perſons and one GOD, to whome be aſcribed all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, praiſe, and glorie nowe and for euer, be with all our ſoules and bodies, to bleſſe, preſerue and keepe vs ſo in
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:2586:191"/>both this way, that wee all of vs li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and dying may keepe a ſteddie and ſtreight courſe therein vntill hee vouchſafe to take vs all hence to be heires of his eternall and euerlaſting kingdome. <hi>Amen. Amen.</hi>
