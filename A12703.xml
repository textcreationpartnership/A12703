            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Whereupon hauing at the earne≈øt and importunate ≈øute and reque≈øt of diuers of my wor≈øhipfull and good friendes, not long ≈øince committed to writing the Treati≈øe following (which
<pb facs="tcp:2586:4"/>in effect they first heard me from point to point in this manner deliuer vnto them in certeine ≈øermons) I haue now thought it good in this ≈øort ≈øomewhat enlarged to publi≈øh it, the better to ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie their de≈øires: and to the end a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore≈øaid, I haue made bolde to dedicate the ≈øame vnto your Grace, be≈øeeching you to accept therof rather according to the minde of the offerer (which I prote≈øt vnto you is full of loue and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence towardes you,) than to the ≈øimplicitie &amp; meane≈ø≈øe of the thing it ≈øelfe, which I mu≈øt needes confe≈ø≈øe in respect of the handling, is much vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie of ≈øuch an Honourable pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trone as your ≈øelfe is. As for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it is (I am per≈øwaded) an≈øwerable to the title that I haue giuen it, which is, The high way to Heauen. For therin
<pb facs="tcp:2586:5"/>fir≈øt is ≈øhewed howe the lawe is our ≈øchoolemai≈øter to Chri≈øt, by cau≈øing vs to knowe our ≈øinnes, and to feele the weight and burthen thereof to make vs wearie of the ≈øame, and therefore to hunger and thir≈øt after him: and then what Chri≈øt is in per≈øon and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and how he is to be apprehended and fed on to ≈øaluation by a true and liuely ≈øaith in him, is largely &amp; plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie declared: and lastly al≈øo, heerein ≈øuch as are and haue beene fir≈øt duely throwen downe by the lawe, and after truelie rai≈øed vp againe by the Go≈øpel, in Christ, are taught how they are to liue and ≈øpend the re≈øt of their daies in holine≈ø≈øe and righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe. Which I am ≈øure is the olde ancient beaten waie throughout all the whole cour≈øe of the olde and new Testament, and in
<pb facs="tcp:2586:5"/>all ≈øound antiquitie, that the ≈øaints and ≈øeruantes of God haue taken to be the onelie ≈øaife and ≈øure wace, wherby they haue ≈øought to come to the kingdom of heauen. Your Grace therfore being one (as I fullie per≈øwade my ≈øelfe you are) that ≈øeeke to come thither by this onelie waie, and therefore one al≈øo that is verie de≈øirous that all others ≈øhould walke thitherwards in an eauen and ≈øtreight cour≈øe therunto; in re≈øpect of the matter therein handled, my good hope is, you will not be a≈øhamed or thinke much at all, that it ≈øeeketh thus to come abroad vnder your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance &amp; protection. For though the waie be neuer ≈øo well knowne alreadie and be beaten and trode out by manie before this, and that perhaps more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly and ≈øub≈øtantially than it is here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb facs="tcp:2586:6"/>in by me: yet ≈øeeing manie are ≈øtill to go this ≈øame way, &amp; all cannot hit of the ≈øame guids, &amp; still Sathan wil be bu≈øie by his complices eyther to keepe men fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> finding it, or by one ≈øleight or other to turne them out of it. I tru≈øt that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ≈øo manie that haue gone before me in guiding men into and keeping them in this way, this my profered ≈øeruice to that end, may &amp; will bee yet profitable vnto many. Now the≈øe <hi>24.</hi> years at the lea≈øt it hath plea≈øed the Lord to v≈øe my poore mini≈øtrie, and that, his name be ble≈ø≈øed for it, in great peace &amp; quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øse, &amp; yet I haue therin alwaies bene of this mind, and am &amp; will be ≈øtil, not to e≈øteeme or know anie thing, but euen this way through Ie≈øus Christ and him crucified. <hi>1.</hi> Cor. <hi>2.2.</hi> And ≈øure I am I find and I per≈øwade my ≈øelfe I ≈øhall still,
<pb facs="tcp:2586:6"/>though I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>tinued therin twi≈øe as long more, this to be a matter ≈øo nece≈ø≈øarie and of that importance beyond all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to be in≈øi≈øted in and dwelt vpon, that I ≈øhould neuer haue either lea≈øure or plea≈øure to trouble eyther pre≈ø≈øe or pulpit with any thing without the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie bondes and ≈øtrict limites hereof. For (alas) euery where, yea euen where mo≈øt paines hath bene taken and yet is by catechi≈øing of &amp; conference with the people, yea by view of their liues, there is eyther ≈øuch gro≈ø≈øe ignorance heereof, or erring or halting heerein to be found &amp; ≈øeene among≈øt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, that if all the ministers of England had the tongues both of men and Angels, they ≈øhould find work inough through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to employ them≈øelues in, onelie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the reformation heereof. I would
<pb facs="tcp:2586:7"/>to God therfore, that all controuer≈øies, wherof men may be ignorant without danger either of not finding, or of not lea≈øing this heauenly way, might either be kept and re≈øerued onely to brotherly and friendlie conferences among the godlie learned, or el≈øe that for euer they might be faire dead and buried among≈øt vs; and that ≈øo, that all of vs as one man with one heart and with one mind, might &amp; would ioyne all our forces together to leade men aright in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this waie, and to keepe them on streight in the ≈øame, what ≈øubtiltie and cunning ≈øoeuer Sathan and his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrumentes ≈øhould at anie time v≈øe to the contrarie. For we may be ≈øure, ≈øo that he any way can get men to mi≈øse or to lea≈øe this waie whiles we are bu≈øying our owne heades and the peoples with
<pb facs="tcp:2586:7"/>other matters of farre le≈ø≈øe impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, though therein we ≈øhew neuer ≈øo much zeale and learning, he hath the verie thing he de≈øireth. For that doubtle≈ø≈øe hath beene and is ≈øtill a dangerous ≈øtratageme or pollicie of his, when he findeth he cannot as he would preuaile by keeping men in ignorance and carele≈ø≈øe ≈øecurity, then to doe what he can, that they may ≈øpend their lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and zeale about matters of the lea≈øt moment; that in the meane time he may the more quietlie by their ≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in matters of greate≈øt weight, by the other contrary way, as it were paue the waie to Athei≈øme: yea I feare much (to ≈øpeake plainely what I thinke) that lacke of due con≈øideration hereof in time, in ≈øome hath not onelie beene one of the next cau≈øes of the phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øticall
<pb facs="tcp:2586:8"/>≈øectes of the Browni≈øtes, and Famili≈øtes, but al≈øo of too ≈øhamefull encrea≈øe, in ≈øo great light of the Go≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, both of Papistes and Atheistes amonge≈øt vs. Wherefore my heartes de≈øire and prayer to God for England is and euer ≈øhall be, and for all the Churches of Chri≈øt where≈øoeuer in the wide world, that this ≈øubtiltie of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than may both heere and euerie where be throughlie well lookt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and the mi≈øchiefe thence en≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be as carefully preuented as po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øiblie may be: for otherwi≈øe it may growe intollerable and vncurable. And J be≈øeech the Lord heartilie to giue your Grace and all the re≈øt of the reuerend Fathers the Bi≈øhops of this land, and all others that be in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie with you in the ≈øame, both skill

            <p>Thus pre≈øuming (as you ≈øee) of your Graces curteous and friendlie acceptance both of this my trauell in pointing out this waie, and al≈øo of this my bold dedicating the ≈øame vnto you: J will not cea≈øe to praie vnto God to

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:2586:11"/>in the temple there, by occa≈øion of the fea≈øt of tabernacles, which then there they kept &amp; ≈øolemnized; where and when the Iewes ≈øought to take him, and therfore pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øely the phari≈øies, and high prie≈øtes ≈øent officers thither, and that to the end that ≈øo he being taken, they might kill him, whereof Chri≈øt was not ignorant.

All the≈øe thinges therefore laid together, ≈øhew vs plainely thus much, that Ie≈øus was the preacher of the ≈øermon, and where, when, and in what manner it was preached by him: namely, that it was preached at <hi>Hieru≈øalem,</hi> euen in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, at and in the fea≈øt of tabernacles, and vpon the la≈øt and mo≈øt ≈øolemne day therof,

Whereas wee (as we haue often ≈øhewed) enforced both by the ≈øcriptures, fathers, rea≈øon, and all experience, confe≈ø≈øe and teach, that by the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> our freewill to and in that which is good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, is ≈øo lo≈øt as that, what good meanes ≈øo euer, at any time be outwardly pre≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto vs, yet thereby we ≈øhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be able to will well, by any power left in vs, nor euer ≈øhall indeede vnle≈ø≈øe GOD inwardlie, by his ≈øpirite withall, fir≈øt create and frame in euerie one of vs a new heart and will, to choo≈øe that which

Who may not therefore, euen hereby plainlie ≈øee, that fathan mightily preuaileth by their doctrine to holde men backe from hungring and thir≈øtinge after Chri≈øte, as they ≈øhoulde? For if originall ≈øinne bring no deeper nor vniuer≈øaller corruption with it then they teache it doth, into the nature of man, and may and is ≈øo quickely and vtterly aboli≈øhed out of the ≈øame againe by bapti≈øme, and man hath in him ≈øelfe remaining ≈øuch a free will to good, that before his conuer≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, vpon the offering of the outward means thereof ≈øufficiently he may be conuerted, if he wil him≈øelfe, and that after he needs no daily or further ≈øupplie of the ≈øpirit to leade his wil alwaies therevnto, but that which he receiued in his fir≈øt conuer≈øion, to worke together with the natiue or hereditarie free will that was before in man: then ≈øure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what is there left, either by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of our originall ≈øinne, or by the viewe of our lacke of free will to good, an in≈øeperable companion thereof, to make vs to long and to thir≈øt after Chri≈øt? For by their doctrine, if we bee but baptized, we are quite rid and freede
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:2586:27"/>from the former, and as for the latter we haue it naturallie ≈øo, as yet it is not quite taken from vs by <hi>Adams</hi> fall, but onely by our ≈øinnes originall and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, ≈øo ≈øettred and hindred that either vpon ≈øufficient meanes, but outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offered, we may v≈øe it againe, euen to the accepting thereof, to our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer≈øion, or after, but by vertue of grace receiued at once in our conuer≈øion, for euer then v≈øe and ≈øhewe it free to the working out of our owne ≈øaluation.

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:2586:35"/>it in parte, that he pronounced them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur≈øed for not keeping it, in whole and in enery point.

That the perfect and exact ≈øen≈øe of the law is rather for men in heauen then in earth, how can it be, ≈øeeing mo≈øt of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes are ≈øuch, as concerne onely this life? our Sabaoth is perpetuall, and not one day in the ≈øeauen, and what di≈øtinction of degrees among≈øt vs are to be imagined there, that we ≈øhould reade the fifth commaundement?

For though this were gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them, that after regeneration, ≈øome thus coulde and did keepe the lawe, yet where finde they that God hath bounde him≈øelfe by any promi≈øe, to giue heauen to any for keeping his lawe, onely in ≈øome part, or for ≈øome peece of his life. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈ø≈øe the promi≈øe that God hath made of life, or reward to the keepers of his law, is, if they, during their whole life whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ob≈øerue the ≈øame, otherwi≈øe hee hath promi≈øed them nothing, but a cur≈øe, as we haue heard before. But to let this pa≈ø≈øe, and to proceede, their next helpes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuges are, that which they holde of veniall ≈øinnes, and of concupi≈øcence, and of the fir≈øt motions to ≈øinne not con≈øented vnto: wherein they ere many waies.

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:2586:47"/>≈øo, and found al≈øo in the ≈øhape of a man, to teach vs, if we will ≈øpeake like the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtle, and ≈øo accordingly beleeue, we mu≈øt not ≈øay nor beleeue that nature tooke na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but the per≈øon of the ≈øonne tooke vnto him≈øelfe the nature of man, and ≈øo, that as he was created, ≈øo it was immediately vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto that per≈øon to haue togither, with that per≈øon, a per≈øonall vnion, and neuer to haue fir≈øt any exi≈øtence or beeing a part, by, or in it ≈øelfe. For then the Apo≈øtle would haue ≈øaid a≈øwell that the thing a≈ø≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, was he that was in the forme of a ≈øeruant, as he had ≈øaid that the a≈ø≈øumer was he that was and had a beeing in the forme of God, which he doth not. The a≈ø≈øumer thefore was the ≈øecond per≈øon in the trinity the ≈øonne of God, and neyther father, nor holie Gho≈øt, nor yet the bare e≈ø≈øence of God but as in it this ≈øecond per≈øon had his exi≈øtence and being; and the a≈ø≈øumed, was not a per≈øon of a man fir≈øt beeing and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i≈øting a part, but the nature with all the a≈ø≈øentiall and in≈øeparable harmele≈ø≈øe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties thereof, of a true and verie man both in re≈øpect of his body and ≈øoule. That by this forme of a ≈øeruant, he ment not any other created nature, but the nature of man, he ≈øufficiently ≈øhe weth, by adding that he
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:2586:47"/>was made in the ≈øimilitude of man, and in ≈øhape found as a man. For <hi>Marcion</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heretiques heere upon gathering, that he a≈ø≈øumed not the verie nature of man, but the ≈øhowe and phanta≈øme of a man, they doe mo≈øt wilfullie but cauill, and foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øhlie ≈øeek to darken a mo≈øt manife≈øt truth.

And heereby al≈øo we may further learne, in that the a≈ø≈øumer, and thing a≈ø≈øumed, are thus both de≈øcribed heere, the one to be that, that had his beeing in the forme of God before, and in this worke remained ≈øtill him≈øelfe: and the other to be the forme of a ≈øeruant, accompanied or inue≈øted with the likene≈ø≈øe &amp; ≈øhape of a ≈øeruant: that both the≈øe, notwith≈øtanding this per≈øonall vnion, are entire and perfect in their owne nature, without any aboli≈øhing of eyther nature, or confounding of other in them≈øelues, or
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:2586:48"/>in the properties with the other in Chri≈øt. La≈øtly the≈øe wordes are plaine and forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to make vs ≈øee, that notwith≈øtanding the a≈ø≈øumer of the forme of a ≈øeruant vnto him≈øelfe, thereby is made in the likene≈ø≈øe of a man, and found in ≈øhape as a man, that yet he is but one per≈øon nowe ≈øub≈øi≈øting, both in the true forme of God, and in the verie nature or forme of man.

And their writing many treati≈øes and large bookes to argue the canonicall ≈øcriptures of ob≈øcuritie (to di≈øcourage the ≈øimple from reading of them or caring to haue them red) and of in≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencie (to e≈øtabli≈øh their vnwritten word of their owne traditions, as the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted word of God,) to what ende el≈øe tendes it, then mo≈øt openly to thru≈øt Chri≈øt from his office of beeing the doctor &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet of his Church, by opening his mouth ≈øo plentifully therein, as he hath, for the ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient direction thereof: that they taking that office vpon them, vnder the title of the Churches practi≈øe and tradition, may war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant all their fooleries and errours, for the

For in his 28.

For that brings one no further then <hi>credere Deo, Deum, &amp; de Deo,</hi> that is, to beleeue or credit God, &amp; to beleeue that he is, &amp; what he is, wheras here in my text expre≈øly Chri≈øt ≈øaith, <hi>he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeueth in me,</hi> thereby requiring that we ≈øhould not thinke it inough to beleeue him as a ≈øpeaker alwaies of trueth, or to beleeue

No maruel though the papi≈øtes can attaine vnto no ≈øuch ioy and peace or a≈ø≈øurance in their con≈øciences of ≈øaluation by their faith. For fir≈øt they build as much of their faith vpon the ≈øandie foundation of their owne traditions, as vpon the rocke of the canonicall ≈øcriptures: ≈øecondly the faith that they talke on, leades them no further then to a generall a≈øtent to all trueth reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by God vnto man in his word, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in particular they neyther thinke the knowledge of all that trueth nece≈ø≈øary, nor yet the ≈øpeciall application of the promi≈øes to any, contenting them≈øelues with belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in generall, that there is in the Church remi≈ø≈øion of ≈øinnes purcha≈øed by Chri≈øt, &amp;c.

<pb n="174" facs="tcp:2586:98"/>then any faith allowed of God, vnle≈ø≈øe God giue a man a ≈øpeciall reuelation, as it were telling him by name in particular, that he ≈øhall haue the≈øe in deed for Chri≈øts ≈øake: and that therefore it is inough for to beleeue that their are the≈øe things in deede by Chri≈øt purcha≈øed. And therfore la≈øtly they holde that faith may be in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate, and that it is ≈øaid to iu≈øtifie one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bicau≈øe it is one of the fir≈øt di≈øpo≈øitions to iu≈øtification, and that it iu≈øtifieth not ≈øo much for apprenending Chri≈øt the iu≈øtifier, as for that it obtaineth that Chri≈øt ≈øhoulde formally iu≈øtify her owner, by powring into him the grace of charity, whereby he may after be able more to iu≈øtifie him≈øelf, and to merite the kingdome of heauen by good works. So that in effect they hold &amp; teach, that it iu≈øtifieth not for Chri≈øt apprehended &amp; applied to her owner, but for charitie and other good works that Chri≈øt by his grace, for the worthine≈ø≈øe therof, be≈øtoweth vpon him quite contrary to the ≈øcriptures; which as we haue heard, ≈øhut workes quite out from this office of iu≈øtifying and purcha≈øing of ≈øaluation for man. Whereas they know further that the ≈øame ≈øcriptures put a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈øt difference betwixt this righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe of the law that lies in doing, and that which

And yet euen their great Doctor <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> neither is nor will be a≈øhamed of any of this their doctrine of faith, and in this la≈øt point, though he be enforced to graunt that we are fir≈øt iu≈øtified freely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out workes in Chri≈øt Ie≈øus, and that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen al≈øo is Gods childrens by adoption and inheritance: yet the formall cau≈øe of our iu≈øtification mu≈øt be with him the infu≈øed habite of charitie, and good workes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter done mu≈øt make vs to haue a ≈øecond right vnto the kingdome of heauen, and ≈øo to further degrees of glory there, by the way of wages and iu≈øt debt.

Wherefore ≈øeeing it hath plea≈øed God to ≈øtoupe ≈øo lowe vnto vs, &amp; thus to apply him≈øelf to our capacity, let vs in the name of God prai≈øe him ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and mo≈øt thankfully take v≈øe of all the meanes that he hath left vs to get vnto his ≈øonne by. And therefore giue me leaue heere to enlarge my ≈øelfe a little vnto you, that there be nothing wanting in mee to ≈øhew you, or to helpe you forward, by the helpe of the≈øe Sacramentes, that I ≈øpeake of, through the working of Gods ≈øpirite in your heartes withall, more and more to come vnto Chri≈øt, and to be v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited vnto him to your euerla≈øting ≈øaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And the rather becau≈øe I know as the right vnder≈øtanding of the nature thereof may by Gods ble≈ø≈øing mightilie helpe you or ward therein; ≈øo eyther the ignorance
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:2586:107"/>thereof, or an erroneous conceite of them may verie much hinder you in the ≈øame. Sacraments I call them, according to the ancient v≈øe, and phra≈øe of the Church: which name I take was at the fir≈øt bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from an ancient fa≈øhion of making a ≈øolemne vow and couenant betwixt the Emperour and his ≈øouldiers, whereby he was bound to them to goe in and out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them as an Emperour, &amp; they bound them≈øelves vnto him againe to be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and obedient ≈øouldiers. And therefore becau≈øe in the≈øe ≈øacred rites it was ob≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that likewi≈øe there pa≈ø≈øeth a ≈øolemne couenant betwixt God and the worthie receiuers thereof, it was thought that not vnfitly they might be called Sacraments. And in verie deede, whether we con≈øider Bapti≈øme or that other of the bodie and blood of Chri≈øt, we ≈øhall ea≈øily finde that thereby this is done. For in Bapti≈øme, the mini≈øter in the name of GOD offereth by bapti≈øing in water, in the name of the Father, the Sonne, and the holie Gho≈øt, vnto the partie baptized not onelie a figure &amp; repre≈øentation of the wa≈øhing away of his ≈øinnes and of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation in the bloode of Chri≈øt, but al≈øo a vi≈øible and ≈øen≈øible ≈øeale thereof,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:2586:107"/>whereby God bindeth him≈øelfe to doe all this for the partie, if the let and ≈øtoppe thereof be not in him≈øelfe: and he likewi≈øe by receiuing this Sacrament maketh o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen profe≈ø≈øion, that he will liue and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue accordingly. And in the other when breade and wine, called as they be, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered vnto the communicant, in like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner then God offereth to feede that partie to eternall life, with the bodie broken and blood ≈øhed of his ≈øon: and he, by taking of them, makes open confe≈ø≈øion that he ≈øo beleeueth and therefore will ≈øo ≈øhew it in his life therafter: and of this mutuall coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant the ≈øacrament deliuered and receiued is a mo≈øt certaine pledge and ≈øeale be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them. It ≈øtandes therefore euery one in hand, that receiue the≈øe Sacraments to haue a greate care, not onelie to beleeue that GOD for his parte will performe that which thereby he bindeth him≈øelfe vnto: but al≈øo for their partes to fulfill that, whereunto they tie them≈øelues: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwi≈øe ≈øure they are no better than di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øemblers before men, and hypocrites be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore GOD.

And in verie deede, it ≈øomewhat well re≈øtraineth the ouerlarge v≈øe of the word: and there is nothinge therein but it is true of Sacraments properly taken as I take them now. But to make it fully to expre≈ø≈øe the nature of a ≈øacrament thus taken, and noe more, I woulde thereunto adde, (and I am ≈øure it ought to be ≈øo) that the in≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutor mu≈øt bee God him≈øelfe; that ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time the outward partis not onely one ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:2586:108"/>to be ≈øeene with the eies, but more then one: and that it is not enough that by ≈øanctification it conferre any vi≈øible grace what≈øoeuer, but that that grace be euen Chri≈øt him≈øelfe with ≈øuch graces as in him re prouided for our ≈øaluation. And therfore I define a Sacrament, as nowe I ≈øpeake thereof, to be <hi>A vi≈øible ≈øigne or ≈øignes, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by Chri≈øt, to be mini≈øtred in his Church to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> that be his, not only to figure &amp; repre≈øent him≈øelfe and what he hath done for their ≈øaluation; but al≈øo whereby to offer him≈øelfe with grace nece≈ø≈øarie to ≈øaluation, and to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer him≈øelfe with the ≈øame, and to ≈øeale the communication and deliuerie thereof, to euery worthy receiuer of the outward element or ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, according to his in≈øtitution.</hi> And ≈øuch we finde no more now in the newe Te≈øtament, but Bapti≈øme and the Lordes Supper.

For ≈øome one or other nece≈ø≈øary thing mentioned in this definition is wanting in euery one of them. And yet there is nothing in this definition that can be omitted, if we minde ≈øo to define or de≈øcribe a Sacrament as that indeed truely, and fully, we meane
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:2586:109"/>to expre≈ø≈øe the nature thereof as it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon but to the≈øe two, Bapti≈øme and the Supper. To the con≈øtitution therefore of a Sacrament by this we may ≈øee that it is fir≈øt nece≈ø≈øarie, that Chr≈øt be the author and in≈øtitutor thereof. Secondly, that there haue a commandement pa≈ø≈øed from him to admini≈øter it in his Church. Thirdlie, that it con≈øi≈øt of ≈øuch outward vi≈øible element or elementes, as he hath cho≈øen and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for that purpo≈øe. And fourthly, that according to his ordinance they be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken as meanes to put him on by, and to make him ours, with all ≈øuch graces as in him are prouided for our ≈øaluation. So that asto the making of a perfect ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> there mu≈øt concurre bodie and ≈øoule in one; and to the being of our Chri≈øt to be a fit per≈øon to be our Me≈ø≈øias and Sauiour, Godhead &amp; man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood: ≈øo to the full beeing of a Sacrament according to Chri≈øts ordinance, an outward element or elements, and Chri≈øt him≈øelfe and his grace fit and needfull for our ≈øal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation are nece≈ø≈øary. And therefore as neither bodie &amp; ≈øoule in man, nor God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head &amp; manhood in Chri≈øt without falling into a gro≈ø≈øe errour there about, can or may be ≈øaid or thought to be eyther confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the other, or annihilated or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øorpted
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:2586:109"/>≈øorpted of the other: ≈øo neyther may we ≈øay or thinke of the≈øe two partes in a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. When therefore we come to receiue any Sacrament; as outwardly we receiue the outward element, ≈øo inwardly we mu≈øt ≈øeeke to receiue al≈øo the heauenly thing thereby offered vnto vs: or el≈øe by our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault we ≈øeuere tho≈øe thinges which we ≈øhould coupple, and as much as lyeth in vs, ouerthrowe the nature and v≈øe of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</p>

But that is but in name, v≈øe, and e≈øtimation. For whereas before they were but called bread and wine, and ≈øerued but to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon v≈øe of the nouri≈øhing and cheering of the bodie, and therefore ≈øo onely were to be e≈øteemed: heerein they beare the names of the verie bodie and bloode of Chri≈øt, and they ≈øerue as the Lordes good meanes to lead and ≈øtrengthen our faith to feede therupon indeed to our ≈øaluation:
<note place="margin">The v≈øe thereof.</note> and therefore we e≈øteeme of them herein, not as they are of their owne nature, but as they are by his in≈øtitution, ≈øacred ≈øignes, ≈øim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols, repre≈øentations, ≈øimilitudes, pledges, and ≈øeales of tho≈øe thinges who≈øe names they beare.

Secondly, knowing the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of bread and wine as you doe, and to what v≈øe they ≈øetue touching this life; they bearing heere the names of the bodie bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and blood ≈øhed of Chri≈øt as they doe, we a≈ø≈øure you that thereby mo≈øt iu≈øtlie we are occa≈øioned to beleue, that in the bodie broken and blood ≈øhed of Chri≈øt, both
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:2586:114"/>the breade and drinke, that is, all the foode that is nece≈ø≈øary for the maintenance of our ≈øpirituall life for euer before God, lieth; and that therfore there it is only to be ≈øought. And in that the≈øe further thus called and v≈øed, are giuen vnto euery one of you that come vnto the Lordes boarde, and you take them, thereby the Lord by vs his mini≈øters particularly offers his bodie broken and his blood ≈øhedde vnto cue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of you, to feede and nouri≈øh you to euerla≈øting life: and you by taking of them in outward ≈øhew, an≈øwere both him and vs, that you doe mo≈øt firmly and ≈øted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fa≈øtly euery one of you particularly beleue, that he will doe ≈øo indeede. Wherefore in any ca≈øe when you ≈øtreach forth your hands and open your mouthes to take breade and wine, thus called, at our hands; take Chri≈øtes ≈øo calling of them to be a mo≈øt follemne promi≈øe to his, to a≈ø≈øure you that if indeede then you beleeue that his body was once broken for you, and his blood ≈øhedde for the remi≈ø≈øion of your ≈øins, as the ≈øtory of his pa≈ø≈øion and this Sacrament, which is a vi≈øible commemoration therof; ≈øhewe, that then vndoubtedly without all que≈øtion, you doe not, nor cannot more ceratinly by tho≈øe in≈øtrumentes of your

And mo≈øt certaine is all this, how≈øoeuer ≈øome would darken all this cleare light, and wipe away all this cleare euidence, by ≈øaying that none el≈øe but the faithfull indeede can worthily eate the fle≈øh of Chri≈øt and drinke his bloode, which are the thinges of this Sacrament:
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:2586:124"/>but yet vnworthily they may. For though we read, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.27. of an vnworthy ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the bread and drinking of the cup, that maketh them guiltie of the bodie and bloode of the Lord, as we haue heard: yet we neuer reade nor ≈øhall in all the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, of an vnworthy eating of his bodie and drinking of his bloode. For if there had beene any ≈øuch, Chri≈øt neyther could nor would haue ≈øaid ≈øo ≈øimplie ab≈øolutely and confidently as he hath, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 6.54. and as we haue alreadie heard he did, <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoeuer eateth my fle≈øh, &amp; drinketh my blood, hath eternall life, and I will rai≈øe him vp at the la≈øt day.</hi> No no, it is not the taking or feeding therupon that can hurtany, but the not doing ≈øo, that bringeth the daunger; e≈øpecially then when yet we would make a ≈øhowe to doe both, and yet indeede doe nothing le≈ø≈øe.
<note place="margin">Chri≈øt is fed on, both God and man.</note> But all this while I vrging the right commumcant in the v≈øe of this Sacrament, to ≈øeeke inwardly by faith to feede vpon the body broken and bloode ≈øhed of Chri≈øt Ie≈øus him≈øelfe when out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly he feedeth vpon bread and wine, I would not be ≈øo taken as though my mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning were to teach, that faith heere were to reach no further then to the vniting of Chri≈øtes bare bodie and bloode, and the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:2586:124"/>right communicant togither. For as he both in bodie and ≈øoule ≈øtandeth neede of him to be his Sauiour, ≈øo it is certaine, as Chri≈øt both God and man perfecte God and perfecte man in one per≈øon is the head and husband of his Church and the redeemer and Sauiour thereof: ≈øo here faith is to feed ≈øo vpon his body broken &amp; blood ≈øhed, as that withall it mu≈øt ≈øtedfa≈øtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue and beleeue that it was &amp; is the body and blood of ≈øuch an one as was and is both very God and man, and yet but one per≈øon. For thence it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>meth that the things done for vs by his broken bodie and blood ≈øhed, though in number and time wherein they were done they were finite, are in the ≈øight of the heauenly Father of infinite value and dignitie (as once I ≈øaid before) to worke our perfect redemption and ≈øaluation, that they were done by ≈øuch a man that had not onely a perfect bodie and ≈øoule of a man, and in them both was ≈øuch an one as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came vs to haue, that was ≈øeperate from ≈øinners, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.27. but al≈øo was and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth for euer a true &amp; euerla≈øting God and therefore was able thus to dignifie the workes done for vs in his manhood.

<pb n="227" facs="tcp:2586:125"/>di≈øciples, who notwith≈øtanding them, taried with him when the other mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured or departed by occa≈øion thereof) but that therin he had this further meaning and purpo≈øe to ≈øhew them that if his fle≈øh and blood were as they tooke them but the fle≈øh and bloode of a man, then they could not be indeed ≈øuch foode for their ≈øoules, as he had taught them to be; but beeing, as they were, the fle≈øh and blood of ≈øuch an one as withall was a ≈øpirit, and that an eternall creating Spirit euen very God, thence they might be ≈øure that they, rightly fed on by faith and the ≈øpirite, both could and would bring life. Thus there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we teach and exhort all men in the v≈øe of this Sacrament, to feede vpon the bodie broken and blood ≈øhed of our Chri≈øt and Sauiour. And yet thus we ≈øpeake with Chri≈øt, and according to the phra≈øe v≈øed in the in≈øtitution therof; becau≈øe as by Chri≈øt God and man, as by our onely me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour we come to the Father; ≈øo it hath plea≈øed God in his word to reueale him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, that by his manhood and the workes done therin, we ≈øhould grow on to faith in his Godhead vnited thereunto and ≈øo ≈øhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning &amp; manife≈øting it ≈øelfe vnto vs therin.</p>
            <p>Thus then I hope by this time, euen by

<pb n="229" facs="tcp:2586:126"/>it is his Table becau≈øe therin he feedeth his with him≈øelf: it is the Sacrament of his body &amp; blood, becau≈øe to his it is a ≈øacred meanes of the Lord to nouri≈øh, ≈øtrengthen, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erci≈øe their faith therein: it is the <hi>Euchari≈øt</hi> becau≈øe thereby we are ≈øo directly &amp; force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably occa≈øioned as we are, to yeeld all hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie thankes vnto God for the death and pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion of Chri≈øt le≈øus, whereof it is ≈øo nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a memorial; and a Sacrifice euen ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore al≈øo it may be tearmed: &amp; al≈øo <hi>Synax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is</hi> it is, becau≈øe it is an excellent bond of our a≈ø≈øemblies and meetings together to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it and la≈øtly, worthily we may and doe call it the Communion, be cau≈øe it is a ≈øeale fir≈øt of our communion with Chri≈øt, and then of one of vs with an other in him. And yet for all this, though this mo≈øt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely be the generall doctrine held with one con≈øent by all the Churches that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øe the Go≈øpell with vs; except of a fewe peeui≈øh and wilfull <hi>Lutherans</hi> our aduer≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, nor the≈øe neither will not be ≈øatisfied, but when we haue ≈øaid and done what we can, all is nothing with them that in this ca≈øe we ≈øay or doe, vnle≈ø≈øe we will with them by vertue of Chri≈øtes wordes ≈øpoken by him in the in≈øtitution heere of, hold ≈øuch a real pre≈øence of Chri≈øtes bodie and blood

            </p>
            <p>Heerein I ≈øhall haue to deale with two ≈øortes of aduer≈øaries: the one ≈øort where of are the <hi>Lutherans</hi> which I late ≈øpok of, who to that end interprete Chri≈øtes words ≈øpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the bread and wine, ≈øo, as that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon they inferre ≈øuch a Con≈øub≈øtantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:2586:127"/>that is, ≈øuch a beeing together of the verie bodie and blood of Chri≈øt with bread and wine in the v≈øe of this Sacrament, that who≈øoeuerreceiues the one with his mouth, receiues the other: and the other ≈øort are our common aduer≈øaries the Papi≈øtes, who interprete the wordes of Chri≈øt ≈øo, as that by the force thereof they teach the bread and wine to be tran≈øub≈øtantiated, that is, to be turned into the bodie and bloode of Chri≈øt, as ≈øome of them haue held; or at lea≈øt thereby, as now mo≈øt of them hold, ≈øo to be conueyed away that there remaines nothing but the accidents thereof, vnder which and together with which the bodie and bloode of Chri≈øt really are ≈øo certainly pre≈øent, that euery receiuer thereof takes into his mouth the verie bodie and bloode of Chri≈øt. Otherwi≈øe the≈øe two are at dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly warre one with another, and the former in mo≈øt of the groundes and principles of Chri≈øtian Religion hold with vs foundly again≈øt the other, and yet in this and for the maintenance of this their carnall and gro≈ø≈øe pre≈øence, they are as vehement and bitter again≈øt vs for the denying &amp; oppug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thereof, as the other. Orderly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore todeale with them both, whereas there are ≈øome thinges in this ca≈øe common to
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:2586:128"/>them both, wherein they both holde alike again≈øt vs; ≈øet vs con≈øider of them &amp; of the groundes thereof fir≈øt, and afterwardes we will take a viewe of tho≈øe thinges and of their groundes al≈øo wherein they differ both betwixt them≈øelues and al≈øo from vs: lea≈øt otherwi≈øe we ≈øhould be driuen tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øly to repeate one thing often. By their bookes that they haue written &amp; daily doe about this matter, it is cuident that they both holde a reall pre≈øence of Chri≈øtes bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and blood together with the outward elements in the v≈øe of this Sacrament: and likewi≈øe, that they both therfore teach, that together with the ≈øame euery receiuer, haue he a right faith or no, receiues in by his mouth the verie real &amp; true bodie &amp; blood of Chri≈øt. And both of them ground both the≈øe their opinions, fir≈øt of Chri≈øtes words vttered of the bread and wine; then of his almightine≈ø≈øe: and la≈øtly of the ≈øtate now of his glorified bodie. In and about the outward elements when they come to be taken of the mouth of the receiuer, what they be and how long this their reall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence of bodie and blood with them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues, they could neuer yet agree. For the maintainers of Con≈øub≈øtantiation plainely with vs, notwith≈øtanding Chri≈øtes wordes
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:2586:128"/>and all their other grounds for their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his reall pre≈øence, holde and teach that they remaine ≈øub≈øtantially bread and wine ≈øtill, and ≈øo are taken and eaten: and the other will haue after tho≈øe wordes are once pronounced, the ≈øub≈øtances of breade and wine to be gone quite, (though vnto this day they coulde neuer agree to tell what was become of them) and the onely accidentes thereof to ≈øupplie the roome al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies after of the outward part of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. The other hold their reall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence continueth no longer, or at lea≈øt is tyed no longer to bread and wine, nor to any more of it then is receiued, and the mini≈øterie thereof la≈øteth. For <hi>Extra v≈øum,</hi> (as they ≈øpeake) that is, be≈øides the v≈øe, they hold neither the bread nor the wine that remaines, to be the bodie and bloode of Chri≈øt: whereas the other ≈øtiflie main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that all the ho≈øtes that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øecrate are euery one of them the bodie of Chri≈øt, and therefore they hang them vp, which they leaue, in a Pixe vnder a Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie and honour and wor≈øhip them as the verie bodies of their Sauiour. And for the wine they take careful order for that, bicau≈øe they cannot tell howe ≈øo well to pre≈øerue and keepe that belike ≈øweete as the other;
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:2586:129"/>to con≈øecrate no more then their prie≈øt may quite and cleane ≈øup vp at that verie time. But to let the≈øe their di≈øagreeings alone, the things wherein they agree herein are nowe to be con≈øidered of: wherein, their manner of reall pre≈øence of Chri≈øt offers it ≈øelfe fir≈øt. Touching the which to begin withall, this I dare be bolde to ≈øay, for I knowe it to be mo≈øt true how drunken ≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer they be with a conceit to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; it is contrarie to all doctrine taught vs in the Scriptures, or in any ancient Father or Councell for ≈øix hundred yeeres after Chri≈øt at the lea≈øt. For with one con≈øent all the≈øe when they ≈øpeake of Chri≈øtes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence in this Sacrament, it is reall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence to the beleeuing communicant, for whom indeed he gaue his bodie and blood, that they ≈øpeake for, and that they ≈øpeake of: as for any ≈øuch reall prefence of his, eyther with or vnder bread and wine or vnder the accidentes thereof, as the≈øe men now plead for, neuer eyther any writer of any of the Canonical Scriptures, nor any ≈øound Father or Councel euer once drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med off. And this reall &amp; true pre≈øence of Chri≈øt to the right receiuer we do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, but we vrge &amp; teach more plainlie and comfortablie than anic of them doc. And
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:2586:129"/>this is it that bringeth in≈øeperablie with it eternal life &amp; ≈øaluation in Chri≈øt; &amp; as for this of theirs, the verie force of trueth &amp; flat experience haue driuen them to confe≈ø≈øe may be, and yet the receiuer thereby ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the better but the wor≈øe. What a vaine thing then is it for men to keepe ≈øuch a ≈øturre to the vexing and di≈øturbing of all Chri≈øtendome for a thing ≈øo fruitle≈ø≈øe? Alas who is ≈øo ≈øimple but that he knoweth or may ≈øoone knowe that Chri≈øtes bodie was broken and his bloode ≈øhed for vs men, and not for breade and wine; and therefore that neyther bread nor wine, are the thinges that haue to doe with his pre≈øence nor yet their accidents, but onely we men: and then that we may haue it ≈øufficiently to our ≈øaluation, who ≈øeeth not that it is the vaine≈øt thing in the world to ≈øtriue for it, for bread and wine and their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentes? Further, ≈øeeing both of the≈øe doe confe≈ø≈øe this to be a Sacrament wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we now intreate, &amp; neither of them yet could ≈øhew or euer went about it, that in any other Sacrament either of the olde or new Te≈øtament there was euer any ≈øuch real coniunction of the inward and ≈øpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al part thereof with the outward, and yet al men know for all that, they were and are
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:2586:130"/>effectuall Sacramentes and ≈øeales of the deliuerie thereof to the right receiuer; what rea≈øon in the world can they haue why they ≈øhould not thinke that this likewi≈øe may be and al≈øo is a full and effectuall Sacrament to participate the bodie and bloode of Chri≈øt without any ≈øuch coupling of them and the outward elements therof, as for the defence of this their real pre≈øence here they vrge? If that were heere nece≈ø≈øarie, it ≈øhould be ≈øo eyther by the generall right of all Sacramentes, or by ≈øome ≈øpeciall right that may be ≈øhewed this hath therunto. But neither of the≈øe can they or ≈øhall they euer be able indeed to ≈øhew in this ca≈øe. Further Chri≈øts owne ≈øitting vi≈øibly ≈øeuered in place without any altering of his forme, or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of his place hauing vttered the words of the in≈øtitution, they being doubtle≈ø≈øe as powrefull then as euer they were ≈øince or ≈øhalbe, to make him really to be pre≈øent to and with the outward elements, doth mo≈øt clearely ouerthrow this conceite. And for the next of hauing him ≈øo really heerewith pre≈øent and conioyned that the receiuers thereof though they haue neyther faith nor good manners, yet receiue him al≈øo ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, as I haue alreadie ≈øufficiently proued, it is both again≈øt Scripture and ≈øound an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie:
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:2586:130"/>and the former beeing ≈øo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øurd, whereupon it followeth and is built, as I haue nowe ≈øhewed it is, that mu≈øt al≈øo therewith fall downe and be ouerthrowne. Yet for the further mabling of thee (wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beloued) to ≈øee yet more not onely the vanitie and impietie thereof, vnder≈øtand that ≈øuch a kinde of pre≈øence of Chri≈øt ≈øhakes all the articles touching the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of Chri≈øt, and in verie deed leades men mo≈øt ≈øtrongly ≈øo to ≈øpoyle him of all the true properties of his manhood, that in effect it leadeth them and mo≈øt forceably teacheth them to denie him indeede to be come into the fle≈øh, and to be the ≈øeede of the woman, of <hi>Abraham, I≈øaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> of <hi>Iuda, Ie≈ø≈øe,</hi> and <hi>Dauid,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ancient prophe≈øies that are of the <hi>Me≈ø≈øiah.</hi> And ≈øo for a bootle≈ø≈øe eating of him and fruitle≈ø≈øe, as they them≈øelues mu≈øt needes confe≈ø≈øe this mouth-eating of him to be, (for that they graunt, ouen to the wor≈øt ≈øort of men that receiue the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward elements,) in the end they will leaue vs no true Chri≈øt at all, eyther for vnbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers or beleeuers to feede vpon. I knowe their refuge and ≈øhift is to auoide this withall, to ≈øay that it is by miracle as they teach, and yet Chri≈øtes manhood and all
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:2586:131"/>the articles touching the ≈øame, true, ≈øound, and whole. Indeede any man may ≈øee that eyther they mu≈øt ≈øay ≈øo, or el≈øe they can ≈øay nothing: and that in trueth and of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolute nece≈ø≈øitie it mu≈øt be graunted to be the greate≈øt miracle that euer was wrought, if it be as they ≈øay, and yet all the≈øe things be vpheld ≈øound according to the true &amp; ancient catholicke faith. For of both the≈øe it mu≈øt needs follow that Chri≈øt at one and ≈øelfe ≈øame time hath a bodie vi≈øible and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ui≈øible, palpable and impalpable, compa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed in place and vncompa≈ø≈øed; yea that he hath but one bodie, and yet many bodies, or that one multiplied into many; vnle≈ø≈øe contrary to manife≈øt Scripture they wilde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie him in the heauens (<hi>Which ≈øhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine him,</hi> as <hi>Peter</hi> ≈øaith, <hi>vntill the re≈øtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of al thinges.

And they know though ≈øundrie of the≈øe Fathers of purpo≈øe haue written of the miracles of the Scripture, that yet they haue not once reckoned vp this of theirs among≈øt them. Neither haue they any rea≈øon why to thinke that there is heere any ≈øuch. A my≈øterie and great my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtery
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:2586:131"/>we willingly acknowledg it to be, that in the right v≈øe of this Sacrament, Chri≈øt by his Spirit by the meanes of the faith of his, verily vnites him≈øelf vnto his: but yet no mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle we count it, or cal it, becau≈øe it is Gods ordinary work in other Sacraments ≈øo to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate him≈øelfe to tho≈øe that rightly v≈øe them: and becau≈øe when he worketh a miracle there is ≈øome ≈øtraunge thing done beyond nature, that the verie ≈øen≈øes can iudge of; which we finde not heere. For they all with one con≈øent iudge them in re≈øpect of their ≈øub≈øtances, to be verie bread and wine ≈øtill in the mouthes of all receiuers. O but (≈øay they) neyther ≈øen≈øe nor rea≈øon are to be con≈øulted withall in this ca≈øe. Indeed I graunt they neuer are again≈øt any trueth certainely taught and warranted by the Scriptures; but when their iudgement concurres and con≈øents therewith, then it is verie lawfull and good to li≈øten thereunto: and ≈øo alwaies haue the godlie learned in all ages thought and taught. And therefore ≈øeeing both ≈øen≈øe and rea≈øon ≈øtriue again≈øt this their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ui≈øe, for the maintenance of Chri≈øtes true manhoode, and the right ≈øen≈øe of all the articles of our faith touching the ≈øame with vs; euen thereby their cau≈øe
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:2586:132"/>hath a greater wound than they are euer able to cure againe. Be≈øides all this, whiles they thus teach without all warrant from Chri≈øt or hir word; they are compelled, lea≈øt otherwi≈øe they ≈øhoulde be inforced; mo≈øt ab≈øurdly to ≈øay that the wicked eate the bodie and blood of Chri≈øt to ≈øaluation; to ≈øeperate Chri≈øt and his ≈øauing graces the one from the other, whereas they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ≈øeuered. For that mu≈øt alwaies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine an ab≈øolute trueth, <hi>Who≈øoeuer eateth his fle≈øh and drinketh his bloode, hath eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life. Iohn.</hi> 6.54. and ≈øo that al≈øo, <hi>he that hath the Sonne hath life, and he that hath not the ≈øonne hath not life. Iohn.</hi> 5.12: A ≈øpirituall vnion and communion with him they ≈øhall both finde oft promi≈øed and ≈øpoken of, as I haue at large alreadie ≈øhewed: but a beeing of his bodie and bloode in the verie mouthes of all recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers as they talke of, otherwi≈øe then Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally, that is, when the outward ≈øacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes or ≈øignes therof are there, they ≈øhall neuer finde ≈øo much as once ≈øpoken for in the ≈øcriptures, or in any ≈øound and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient writer indeed. I cannot denie but that indeed the <hi>Capernaits, Iohn.</hi> 6. by mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceiuing of Chri≈øtes ≈øpeeches there had of the eating of his fle≈øh and drinking of
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:2586:132"/>his blood, began to dreame that he meant ≈øome ≈øuch thing: but we haue heard that <hi>Chri≈øo≈øtome</hi> plainely ≈øheweth by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwere that he made them, that he had no ≈øuch meaning; his wordes were ≈øpiritually to be vnder≈øtood, and ≈øo ≈øhould giuelife and not otherwi≈øe. And <hi>Athana≈øius</hi> vpon the≈øe wordes, <hi>Who≈øoeuer ≈øpeaketh a worde again≈øt the Sonne of man,</hi> writeth that withall then Chri≈øt put them in minde of his a≈øcen≈øion, as indeed he did <hi>Iohn.</hi> 6.62. to draw them from corporall and fle≈øhly vnder≈øtanding of his wordes. And therefore verie excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently hath <hi>Augu≈øtine,</hi> to preuent all ≈øuch conceits or murmuring, by occa≈øion of that doctrine of Chri≈øt, written of tho≈øe words of his whereat they ≈øo ≈øtumbled; in his third booke of chri≈øtian doctrine, <hi>Chap.</hi> 16. ≈øaying thus, That ≈øaying of Chri≈øt, <hi>except ye eate the fle≈øh of the Sonne of man &amp; drinke his bloode, ye haue no life, &amp;c.</hi> ≈øeemeth to commend an heinous thing and a wicked: and therefore it is a figure commaunding vs to be partakers of Chri≈øtes pa≈ø≈øion, and to keepe in our mindes to our great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and profit that his fle≈øh was crucified and wounded for vs. But I am not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant that the≈øe men would ≈øeeme to mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the <hi>Capernaits</hi> opinion as much as we;
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:2586:133"/>and that therefore they labour to put an infinite difference betwixt their fan≈øie of eating his fle≈øh and drinking his bloode, and this of theirs. For they imagined (≈øay they) that then they ≈øhould feede vpon them vi≈øiblie, and by piece-meale as they did of other their v≈øuall meat and drinke: whereas they purpo≈øe them to be fed on inui≈øibly and wholly. But alas what a poore difference is this, as though it were not as much again≈øt the lawe of God the law of all nations and nature al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øo, knowing it, to eate and drinke mans fle≈øh and bloode vn≈øeene as ≈øeene, all at a mor≈øell or at a ≈øup, as by many mor≈øels and ≈øuppes? If yet they will needes vrge this their reall pre≈øence and their mouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eating really of Chri≈øt, how will they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyde the daunger then, that that generall and vniuer≈øall propo≈øition of Chri≈øt will bringe them vnto, ≈øaying as we reade he did <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.17: <hi>What ≈øoeuer entreth into the mouth goeth into the bellie, &amp; is ca≈øt out into the draught, &amp;c?</hi> Euen this hath cau≈øed many both as learned as any of them and farre more ancient, to vnder≈øtand the eating of Chri≈øt to be by the mouth of the ≈øoule, faith; and not by the very mouth of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die. And they know, with one con≈øent the
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:2586:133"/>ancient Fathers teach that the wicked and vnbeleeuing whiles they remain ≈øuch, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eate the bodie and bloode of Chri≈øt: which they neither could nor would haue done, if they had knowne that there was any ≈øuch reall pre≈øence, eyther by Tran≈øub≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation or Con≈øub≈øtantiation, as nowe the≈øe men teach. For eyther of the≈øe beeing graunted, the other how ab≈øurd ≈øoeuer it be mu≈øt follow thereupon. And therefore is it, becau≈øe they know that the Con≈øequent being ab≈øurd the Antecedent fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> whence it floweth mu≈øt needs be ≈øo al≈øo, that the≈øe men are thus eager to defend this to be no ab≈øurditie, that all that communicate, though they be neuer ≈øo bad and faithle≈ø≈øe, eate the bodie and drinke the bloode of Chri≈øt really: for otherwi≈øe they know they cannot defend any longer their reall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence as they do. For I≈øee no cau≈øe el≈øe why they ≈øhould make ≈øo much a doe for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons ≈øo vnworthie to haue ≈øuch care and paines taken for them.</p>
            <p>But yet ≈øo wedded are the≈øe men vnto their groundes that they haue builded this their fancie vpon mentioned before,
<note place="margin">Chri≈øtes wordes proue not their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe.</note> that vnle≈ø≈øe we can driue them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> thence, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with≈øtanding all yet ≈øaid again≈øt it, it is to be feared that they wil think that they both
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:2586:134"/>may and ought to holde it ≈øtill. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, whereas fir≈øt they ≈øeeme to thinke that the wordes of Chri≈øt are plaine and preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to prooue their kind of reall pre≈øence, and mouth-eating con≈øequently of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and bloode; doubtle≈ø≈øe if with a ≈øingle eie and without any preiudicate opinion we con≈øider thereof, we ≈øhall ≈øoone ≈øee that it is nothing but peeui≈øhne≈ø≈øe &amp; wilfulne≈ø≈øe that makes them eyther ≈øo to ≈øay or thinke. That the wordes of Chri≈øt are mo≈øt certaine and true in the ≈øen≈øe that he meant them when he vttered them, we neuer denied nor will; no nor yet we neuer gaue leaue vnto our ≈øelues ≈øo much as once to doubt thereof. Wherefore if any of them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwade any man otherwi≈øe of vs, they doe vs open and manife≈øt wrong. Neither can we thinke ≈øo vncharitablie of them, but that we are per≈øwaded that they ≈øo likewi≈øe thinke of them. Heerein then is the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and controuer≈øie betwixt them and vs, whether we or they hit of the right ≈øen≈øe thereof. Which beeing the que≈øtion indeed as it is; for the determining herof euery rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øonable man mu≈øt needes confe≈ø≈øe, that who≈øe interpretation agrees be≈øt with the nature of the thing in hand, with the ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie of faith and good manners, with the
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:2586:134"/>re≈øt of the Scriptures and ≈øound antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that is to be taken be≈øt to agree with Chri≈øtes meaning, and therefore is the fen≈øe to be followed and preferred before all others. Nowe we interprete the wordes of Chri≈øt as ≈øpoken by a <hi>Metonymie,</hi> that is, by a figure of ≈øpeech whereby one thing beares the name of the other; as heere bread and wine we ≈øay doe, of the bodie broken and blood ≈øhed of Chri≈øt; becau≈øe the one both ≈øignifies and repre≈øentes the other vnto vs, and al≈øo a≈ø≈øures vs rightlie receiuing the one, that we are and ≈øhalbe partakers al≈øo of the other. The≈øe men crie and vrge that the wordes are plaine and without any ≈øuch figure, and yet how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoeuer they therefore agree that they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port a reall pre≈øence to the outward cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, and to the mouth of euerie recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer (as we haue heard;) yet the one ≈øorte would haue them expounded to that end to inferre Con≈øub≈øtantiation, and the other a Tran≈øub≈øtantiation. Iudge therefore now I be≈øeech you by the fore≈øaid rules, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theirs or ours be like≈øt to be Chri≈øtes meaning. The matter in hande, when tho≈øe wordes were fir≈øt vttered by him, was a Sacrament: and they know as wel as we, that in all other Sacramentes when
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:2586:135"/>eyther they were in≈øtituted by God, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ≈øpoken of by him; though the very like Phra≈øes for all the world were v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed of them, that are here by Chri≈øt of the≈øe: that yet vnto this day neuer any of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelues or others expounded them eyther as they doe the≈øe heere, or otherwi≈øe then we doe the≈øe. Circumci≈øion is called the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.10. the Lamb the Pa≈ø≈øeouer, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.21. the rocke that the people of I≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael dranke the water of in the wilderne≈ø≈øe Chri≈øt. 1. <hi>Cor</hi> 10.4. the blood of their ≈øacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, the blood of the Couenant, <hi>Exod.</hi> 24.8. the Arke, the King of glorie and <hi>Iehouah. P≈øal.</hi> 24.8.10. and Bapti≈øme is called the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer or wa≈øhing of our new birth, Tit. 3.5. And yet who euer expounded the≈øe phra≈øes eyther by Tran≈øub≈øtantiation or Con≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtantiation, thereby really to make alwaies pre≈øent to euery of the≈øe outward elements the ≈øpirituall matter thereby ≈øignified and re≈øembled? yea, who euer vnder≈øtoode the≈øe otherwi≈øe, then to be as the wordes import, onely by ≈øignification &amp; repre≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and for the a≈ø≈øurance of the right v≈øers of them, of the pre≈øence to them of the thinges therby ≈øignified and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øented ≈øpiritually? Why therfore ≈øhould Chri≈øt either ≈øpeake otherwi≈øe in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtituting of this, then had beene v≈øed in
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:2586:135"/>all other Sacraments; or ≈øpeaking but euen ≈øo, what rea≈øo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> is there why his ≈øpeach ≈øhould otherwi≈øe be vnder≈øtood heere then in all the re≈øt? To ≈øay that this hath a ≈øpecial and e≈ø≈øentiall difference from all other Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and therefore though the≈øe phra≈øes be ≈øo to be taken in all other, yet they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ≈øo be in this: though when they ≈øay ≈øo they thinke they haue ≈øaid much to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe, yet indeed they haue ≈øaid nothing. For who knoweth not that a man hath an e≈ø≈øential difference to di≈øtingui≈øh him from all other creatures vnder the ≈øame General that he is? And yet that letteth not but that what≈øoeuer belongs to the nature of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>mon to him with al the re≈øt? For el≈øe he ≈øhould not be defined by his Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. So if that which appertains to the nature of a Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t in general, of which ≈øort this is that now we talk of, were not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>mon vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this with the re≈øt, it could not with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> be ≈øaid, to be a Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t as it is. If therfore the outward elements bearing the names of the inward graces, neither inforce or impart any ≈øuch thing in any of the other, no rea≈øon is there why it ≈øhould in this. And ≈øurely the di≈øciples beeing ≈øo well acquainted with ≈øuch kind of phra≈øes in al the ≈øacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ts of the old Te≈øtament, therby were prepared quietly to heare Chri≈øt to v≈øe the like in this,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:2586:136"/>and readily &amp; rightly they vnder≈øtood him as in the other: &amp; therfore neuer once were offended or ama≈øed at his ≈øpeach, or made any que≈øtioning with him eyther then or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards about the ≈øen≈øe therof. Whereas if they had taken them in any ≈øuch ≈øen≈øe, and had thought that they did import any ≈øuch matter as eyther of the≈øe ≈øortes of men imagine they did; they beeing ≈øo bold with him at other times alwaies in matters of farre le≈ø≈øe importance and difficulty as to inquire his meaning, they woulde al≈øo doubtle≈ø≈øe ≈øo haue done in this. Which thing in ≈øome ≈øort, and that with ≈øome fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matter verie fit to cro≈ø≈øe the≈øe mens conceit, <hi>Chri≈øo≈øtome</hi> in his 83. Homilie vpon <hi>Mathew</hi> hath noted ≈øaying, euen ≈øpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the wordes of the in≈øtitution now in que≈øtion: <hi>Quomodo non turbati erant, cum hoc audi≈ø≈øent? quia multa &amp; magna de hoc antea di≈ø≈øeruit, &amp;c.</hi> that is, <hi>how came it to pa≈ø≈øe that they were not troubled</hi> (meaning his di≈øciples) <hi>when they heard this? becau≈øe many &amp; weightie things he had di≈øcour≈øed of this before vnto them.</hi> And a little after he noteth, that he him≈øelfe drunke thereof, lea≈øt hearing tho≈øe wordes they ≈øhoulde haue ≈øaid; what then doe we drinke blood and eate his fle≈øh? and therefore ≈øhoulde
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:2586:136"/>haue beene troubled. For when he fir≈øt ≈øpoke hereof (≈øaith he) many were offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded onely for his wordes: lea≈øt therefore heereby that al≈øo now ≈øhould haue chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, he did this fir≈øt him≈øelf that ≈øo he might with a quiet minde induce them to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of the≈øe my≈øteries. Now as for the ≈øecond rule to examine our expo≈øition of the≈øe wordes by, that which I haue ≈øaid alreadie is both ≈øufficient to iu≈øtifie ours, and to condemne theirs. For in nothing ours can be ≈øaid to be contrarie, or but to carie any ≈øhew of contrarietie eyther to the doctrine of good manners or to the analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie of faith (if you ≈øhoulde examine from point to point our iudgement hereof and of the nature and v≈øe of the whole Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as I haue expre≈ø≈øed it;) and theirs, as I lately ≈øhewed in the confutation of their reall pre≈øence, both in ≈øhewe and in trueth mo≈øt directly cro≈ø≈øeth &amp; contrarieth both. For hath not euen nature a loathing to the taking in by mouth and ≈øo ≈øwallowing of a whole man, fle≈øh, bloode, and bones at one mor≈øell? And a man that can be ≈øo taken in and eaten of ≈øo many communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantes as be in worlde at one time, who can be per≈øwaded that he hath the true nature indeed of a man? And come to the third,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:2586:137"/>that is, by the Scriptures them≈øelues to trie this matter by, and quickly we ≈øhal find by them our expo≈øition warranted, and this of theirs and the con≈øequents thereof confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. For fir≈øt, whereas they would counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance theirs again≈øt ours, by ≈øaying that Chri≈øtes words are plaine &amp; without figure; looke but a little vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, and you ≈øhalbe inforced to confe≈ø≈øe, &amp; ≈øo they al≈øo wil they nil they, that he hath v≈øed in the in≈øtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> of this Sacrament, in his words ≈øundry figures. For fir≈øt he ≈øaith of the one that it was his body giuen for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, as <hi>Luke</hi> ≈øaith, or broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> for them, as <hi>Paule</hi> ≈øpeaketh: &amp; then of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that it was his blood ≈øhed for them, as <hi>Mathew, Marke</hi> &amp; <hi>Luke</hi> report his words; ≈øo ≈øpeaking of that which yet then was not done, as it is wel known, as though the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> it had bene done, by an v≈øual figure in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, v≈øing the time pa≈øt or pre≈øent for the time to come.

We read <hi>Act.</hi> 1.11. that ≈øhortly after the in≈øtitution of this Sacrament he vi≈øibly a≈øcended into heauen, the Apo≈øtles ≈øeing him ≈øo to doe with their eyes: and there we read al≈øo that the Angels told them, that even ≈øo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe he ≈øhoulde come againe when he comes from thence: reading al≈øo as we doe and haue alreadie noted once or twi≈øe, <hi>that the heauens mu≈øt containe him vntill the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtitution of all things.

May we thinke with <hi>Peter,</hi> that the heauens doe and ≈øhall containe him ≈øtill, and that yet vpon this occa≈øion he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies thus heere? And that beeing ≈øo, how can it be that his comming from thence at the la≈øt daie, ≈øhall be but his ≈øecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, or that it is true when he comes from thence he ≈øhall come vi≈øibly, no ≈øuch thing hauing euer beene ≈øeene heere. I knowe they will ≈øay, all the≈øe places are to be vnder≈øtood of his vi≈øible body, and that they ≈øpeake of his inui≈øible bodie. Yea but then we replie, where euer learned they
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:2586:140"/>either in Scripture, or in any ancient Father, that euer he had any ≈øuch inui≈øible bodie: or howe can they euer make it ≈øinke into any mans head that hath rightlie learned in the Scriptures to know Chri≈øtes manhood, that at one and ≈øelfe ≈øame time he ≈øhoulde haue a vi≈øible bodie and an inui≈øible, yea one in the heauens to come inui≈øiblie againe when he plea≈øeth; and yet the ≈øame both there and this heere al≈øo multiplied into ≈øo many inui≈øible bodies as there be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers mouthes? If this be not with the olde rotten doting and long agoe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned <hi>Marcion</hi> to make a meere phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta≈øme of the bodie of Chri≈øt, let any man iudge. But once for all by this ≈øworde of the Spirit, to pierce this mon≈øtrous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt of theirs to the verie heart and ≈øo to leaue it for dead: ≈øeeing they ≈øtande ≈øo much vpon the letter and wordes of the text, I would haue them once againe to marke and remember that Saint <hi>Paule,</hi> that ≈øaith therein <hi>That which he receiued of the Lord he deliuered,</hi> hath vpon his credite told vs that the Lord ≈øpeaking of the bread called it not ≈øimplie and nakedly his bodie, but his bodie broken; and they all agree in one that he called the other his blood ≈øhed. If therefore they will ≈øticke
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:2586:140"/>to the wordes of the text, and yet haue a reall pre≈øence as they teach, of his verie bodie and blood by vertue of the wordes thereof; they ≈øee mo≈øt plainely then it mu≈øt be of his bodie broken and of his blood ≈øhed. Vnle≈ø≈øe therefore nowe they can finde vs an inui≈øible bodie broken and blood inui≈øible ≈øhed of his, for the mouth of euerie receiuer, they neither ≈øay or doe any thing to the purpo≈øe according to the text. But I hope they are not ≈øo farre gone, but they know that it is now a thou≈øand and fiue hundred yeares agoe and more, ≈øince he had eyther his bodie broken or blood ≈øhed; and that when they were ≈øo, he died ≈øo that he dies no more, as we reade. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.9. And therefore e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen heereby the mo≈øt ≈øimple may ≈øee that though they could ≈øhew that his bodie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue or glorified could be inui≈øible, infinite, and ≈øo multipliable as their doctrine im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portes, which yet they can neuer doe; that yet all this were nothing to the reall pre≈øence of the bodie and blood of Chri≈øt in re≈øpect of that e≈øtate of his, when the one was broken, and the other ≈øhed for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øion of our ≈øinnes. And yet heereby it is mo≈øt euident that the bodie and bloode of Chri≈øt, in re≈øpect of this their e≈øtate
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:2586:141"/>and condition, are the bodie and blood of his, that expre≈øly by the words of the in≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution we are heere to ≈øeeke for and to feede vpon. How can this then be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe but as we teach, by calling heereby to our remembrance, that once mo≈øt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely they were thus handled for vs; and by beleeuing that therby our ≈øaluation was wrought: which as oft as we doe, we are fed and nouri≈øhed therewith to eternall life. Thus then you ≈øee, the matter in hand, the Analogie of faith and good manners, and not onely other Scriptures, but the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie words of the in≈øtitution lead ≈øtrongly to the maintena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ce of our expo≈øitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> of Chri≈øts words in the in≈øtitution of this Sacrament, and to the vtter ouerthrow of theirs. And truely the ancient Fathers, as we haue a thou≈øand times ≈øhewed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, are wholly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øo of our ≈øide, again≈øt them. It were infinite to bring al that might be found in them to this purpo≈øe, as by large volumes written and publi≈øhed by vs about this matter we haue made it euident. Howbeit, ≈øomwhat yet now againe let vs heare what ≈øome of the chiefe of them haue ≈øaid.

And what can be plainer then the≈øe eyther again≈øt them, or for vs? All the≈øe thinges con≈øidered therefore, we may boldlie conclude that they haue no ground from Chri≈øtes wordes for their gro≈ø≈øe reall pre≈øence.</p>
            <p>And ≈øurely as little haue they eyther from his omnipotencie,
<note place="margin">Neither his omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency, nor glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed body will helpe them.</note> or from the ≈øtate of his glorified bodie.

<pb n="263" facs="tcp:2586:143"/>per≈øwade men, that it may be as they ≈øay in re≈øpect of his body now glorified, though not in re≈øpect therof before; ≈øeing it is mo≈øt certaine, that when Chri≈øt in≈øtituted this Sacrament, his body was not glorified, and by his words expre≈øly, as I lately ≈øhewed, he in≈øtituted this to be a Sacrament of his body broken and bloode ≈øhed? For who doth not, or at lea≈øt may not heereby per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, that we haue not here any otherwi≈øe to deale with his e≈øtate glorified, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> therby now the more ≈øtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>gly to be per≈øwaded that indeed he is able to feede vs with his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken body &amp; blood ≈øhed once to our eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ≈øaluation?

But vnles we would haue Chri≈øt otherwi≈øe now to be pre≈øent to vs and our mouthes, then he was when he him≈øelf mini≈øtred it to the di≈øciples, and

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uey and banni≈øh away the ≈øub≈øtances of bread and wine, and leaue nothing but the bare accidents thereof, vnder which they hold lu≈øtilie Chri≈øt to be fle≈øh, blood &amp; bone.

But for all this their ≈øturre it ≈øhould ≈øeeme yet that nowe they are per≈øwaded they haue him rather by banni≈øhing of bread and wine (though they cannot tell
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:2586:159"/>eyther how, whither, or into what,) then by tran≈øub≈øtantiation of breade and wine thereinto or of anything el≈øe. How≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it were or bee, that there ≈øhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine nothing but the bare accidentes or out ward formes of bread and wine that is inough vtterly to ouerthrow the nature of the Sacrament. For in Sacramentes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies there mu≈øt bee an Analogie betwixt the ≈øignes and the thinges ≈øignified, which cannot be betwixt bare accidents of bread and wine, (for that they alone feede not at all) and the bodie and blood of Chri≈øt which are our foode to eternall life: and therfore to aboli≈øh or abandon by what meanes ≈øoeuer bread &amp; wine, is to de≈øtroy quite the nature of the Sacrament. That the verie ≈øub≈øtances thereof remaine for all their prating, when they haue v≈øed all their art &amp; the trickes therof they can, both Scripture, Fathers, and rea≈øon make it mo≈øt euident. For in the wordes of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtitution, ≈øcanne and marke them wel who li≈øt, it is mo≈øt cleare that Chri≈øt tooke verie bread and wine, and that he both gaue that which he tooke and that they tooke the ≈øame and no other, though by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtitution now chaunged in name, v≈øe, and e≈øtimation as I haue ≈øaid. And therefore
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:2586:160"/>
               <hi>Paule</hi> retaineth the name of the bread and cup ≈øtill, euen when they come to be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and drunken vpon, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. and Chri≈øt calles it the fruite of the vine tree, and that after he had deliuered it, and they had drunken therof. <hi>Mar.</hi> 14.25. And in all other Sacramentes as we haue hearde, though the like phra≈øe of ≈øpeach haue bene v≈øed, yet alwaies haue they beene fulland forcible Sacramentes to offer, to deliuer, and to ≈øeale the deliuerie of the inwarde grace thereby intended to the right recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, without any ≈øuch aboli≈øhing or tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øub≈øtantiating of the outwarde elements thereinto, as is heere imagined. And if Chri≈øt had had anie ≈øuch purpo≈øe, it had ≈øure beene as ea≈øie a matter with him to haue vttered his minde in and by wordes ≈øounding plainely that he ment to effect ≈øome ≈øuch thing (as by ≈øaying, this is turned into my bodie, or let this be tran≈øub≈øtantiated thereinto, or let the ≈øub≈øtance of this cea≈øe, and in the romph thereof let my bodie come and bee) as onely to haue ≈øaide affirmatiuelie that it was his bodie. But hauing but ≈øaide ≈øo, it is mo≈øt certaine it was ≈øome certaine thing that he affirmed to be ≈øo: for he would neuer call bare nothing or an <hi>indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiduum
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:2586:160"/>vagum,</hi> an vncertaine thing, (as <hi>Gardiner</hi> holds he ment by This) his bodie. And therefore wil they nil they, by Chri≈øts words interpreted as they doe, eyther we mu≈øt haue Chri≈øtes bodie, which once was of the nature of the Virgin his Mother (that ≈øo he might be that ≈øeede of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to treade downe the ≈øerpentes head, and in whome all the nations of the world ≈øhoulde be ble≈ø≈øed) when≈øoeuer any of their prie≈øtes therby intend to con≈øecrate (as they ≈øpeake) made of a wafer againe; or at lea≈øt now growne to be ≈øuch an one as that it can lie hid vnder the forme ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the ≈øub≈øtance of breade beeing gone to giue it romph. But once againe I mu≈øt tel them that the words of Chri≈øt are ≈øo farre from ≈øounding any ≈øuch thing, as that if they ≈øhould be taken litterally as they ≈øound, they rather ≈øhew that his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and blood were become bread &amp; wine or turned thereinto, then the contrary. For when <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> rod was turned into a ≈øerpent, or when <hi>Lots</hi> wife was turned into a pillar of ≈øalt, if one ≈øhoulde haue ≈øaide of the one that it was <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> rod, or of the other that it was <hi>Lots</hi> wife, woulde anie thereby haue vnder≈øtoode that he mente that the ≈øcrpent was tran≈øub≈øtantiated into the
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:2586:161"/>rod or the pillar of ≈øalt into <hi>Lots</hi> wife, nay would not the verie ≈øounde of the wordes mo≈øt plainly lead any man rather to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand that his meaning was to ≈øhew <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes</hi> rod was turned into the ≈øerpent, and <hi>Lots</hi> wife into the pillar of ≈øalt? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they haue not onely no ground in the Scriptures for this their opinion, but not onely other ≈øcriptures but the verie words of the in≈øtitution are directly again≈øt them. And the ancient Fathers are plaine that though Chri≈øt called breade and wine his bodie broken and his blood ≈øhed, that yet neyther by tran≈øub≈øtantion nor anie way el≈øe the ≈øub≈øtances thereof are gone. <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odoret</hi> both in his fir≈øt Dialogue &amp; ≈øecond al≈øo, though mo≈øt plainely (as I haue noted alreadie) he confe≈ø≈øe that Chri≈øt honored bread and wine with the names of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and blood, mo≈øt flatly ≈øaith that yet he changed not their natures but added grace to nature, and that the my≈øticall ≈øignes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ≈øanctification (as he plea≈øeth to ≈øpeake) goe not from their nature, figure or forme.

<pb n="298" facs="tcp:2586:162"/>then Manna and the water of the rocke in the wildernes were Chri≈øt, which all men knowe they were but by repre≈øenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ≈øignification, and not really; for that then Chri≈øt was not become man.

And if it were granted then that Chri≈øt to exempt and to pre≈øerue his bodie from the≈øe inconueniences re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moues it away before any of the≈øe can fal out vnto it, yet then they graunt that the be≈øt ≈øhift that their popi≈øh Chri≈øt hath in this ca≈øe is to runne away or to giue place. Such a Chri≈øt may become ≈øuch kinde of Chri≈øtians; but ≈øurely the wi≈øe hearted Chri≈øtians would be loth to tru≈øt to ≈øuch a Chri≈øt for their ≈øaluation who≈øe be≈øt ≈øhift is thus to flie that a Mou≈øe eate him not; and I would adui≈øe them not to tru≈øt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelues too much to ≈øuch a da≈øtardly Chri≈øt.

But ≈øeeing they like better to prouide for their Chri≈øt by his ≈øuddaine departure, I would haue them to tell mee,

For that were vndoubtedly (how≈øoeuer they would per≈øwade men to the contrary) no

And ≈øo often in the olde Te≈øtament, the Prophets hauing an eye to the wonderfull mea≈øure of Gods grace and plentifulnes of Gods ≈øpirit, that ≈øhould be powredour, vpon the Church the Me≈ø≈øias being come, though in very deede they ≈øpeake but by compari≈øon, and ≈øo of nece≈ø≈øitie mu≈øt be vnder≈øtoode (for el≈øewhere very plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they ≈øhewe that the ≈øpirit of God was in good mea≈øure vpon them ≈øelues and vpon others then) yet they vtter the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øes of God touching his powring out of his Spirit then, as though it were a new thing, that hee had neuer done before: as you may ≈øee and beholde in the 44. of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øay,</hi> and in the 2. of <hi>Ioell</hi> in the places before alleaged.

<pb n="319" facs="tcp:2586:172"/>might be made manife≈øt vnto his Church, to begette in the ≈øame a ≈øtronge and liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hope; that as by his humiliation and aba≈øemente he had obtained and purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed for it eternall redemption, ≈øo now by his exaltation and aduancemente, he was ≈øo ≈øetled at the right hande of his Father, that he was able to poure downe vpon the ≈øame, all giftes and graces ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øarie to the effectuall applying and ≈øealing the ≈øame thereunto. So that thenceforth none neede doubte but that he hath gone through with the worke of our redemption and ≈øaluation, and that as heade and hu≈øband ouer his Church, he can and will guide, decke, and ≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øh the ≈øame with all the rich trea≈øures of the graces of GOD, which dwell and re≈øt in him as in the fountaine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yonde all mea≈øure, that of his ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing and infinite fullnes, euery mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thereof might receiue inough, to bring it to perfection in him; as mo≈øt notably <hi>Paule</hi> teacheth, <hi>Ephe≈ø.</hi> 4. <hi>Ver≈ø.</hi> 9. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But yet neither Chri≈øt, nor <hi>Iohn</hi> heere are ≈øo to bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtoode, as though this promi≈øe of Chri≈øt heere were limited and to bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended noe further than to tho≈øe,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:2586:173"/>vpon whom after his a≈ø≈øention in that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary manner he be≈øtowed his ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite &amp; the giftes thereof, though I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but thinke they had an e≈øpeciall and fir≈øt eye vnto them, as vnto the fir≈øt fruites of all the re≈øt that ≈øhoulde follow. For doubtles as Chri≈øt requireth all, that he ≈øpake of before, that thir≈øt to come vnto him to drinke and to beleeue in him, as ≈øaith the Scripture, and therefore lookes for all this at the handes of euery true member of his my≈øticall bodie the church: ≈øo the thing promi≈øed appertaineth and is common to them all, though according to the diuer≈øitie of places that they hold in that bodie, one and the ≈øelfe ame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is diuer≈øly be≈øtowed vpon them, as we are taught 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. <hi>Ver.</hi> 4. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that the Spirit and the giftes and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God, are here ≈øo promi≈øed to them all, and ≈øhalbe and are performed, as that aptly they may be called riuers of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of life flowring out of their bellies. But yet then ≈øome may maruaile, comparing the ≈øpirit and giftes thereof ≈øeene in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the faithfull, ≈øince Chri≈øt was glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, with the Spirit and giftes thereof founde in ≈øundry, as in the Patriarches and Prophets and other famous holy men in
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:2586:173"/>the olde Te≈øtament, and finding them in ≈øhow to be but equall, or rather inferiour to ≈øome of theirs, why <hi>Iohn</hi> ≈øhoulde ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ≈øimply or by waie of compari≈øon, thus ≈øignifie vnto vs that the Spirite had not beene giuen in ≈øuch mea≈øure before, as nowe Chri≈øt beeing glorified it ≈øhould. Whereunto though I might an≈øwere that <hi>Iohn</hi> might well ≈øay ≈øo, in that then the partition wall betwixt Iew and Gentile ≈øhoulde be pulled downe, and ≈øo the borders &amp; compa≈ø≈øe of the Church ≈øhould wonderfully be enlarged, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon they were before: yet more fullie to aun≈øwere this obiection, though in re≈øpect of tho≈øe times wherein the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarches and Prophets and holie men of GOD liued, in the time of the olde Te≈øtament, their faith and other fruites of the Spirite that appeared and were founde in them, were verie commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yet in many re≈øpectes <hi>Iohn</hi> might preferre the Spirite and the giftes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of giuen to beleeuers in the newe Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtament ≈øo before them in the olde, that in compari≈øon thereof, the Spirite might be ≈øaide not to haue beene before. For fir≈øt, though then the my≈øteries of religion were ≈øufficientlie reuealed for
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:2586:174"/>tho≈øe times; yet were they not opened ≈øo clearely and light≈øomely then, as now ≈øince the comming of Chri≈øt: and the Spirit that, he beeing a≈øcended, he promi≈øeth to his, leadeth them to all trueth and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them all thinges, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 14.26. In ≈øo much that the beleeuing Chri≈øtian nowe can ≈øpeake by direction therof, more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Trinitie, of Chri≈øtes per≈øon and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and of many other my≈øteries of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtian religion, than any of them had done or could. In re≈øpect and regard whereof, Chri≈øt ≈øaith of <hi>Iohn Bapti≈øt,</hi> verily verily among≈øt them that are begotten of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, aro≈øe there not a greater: and yet notwith≈øta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ding he that is lea≈øt in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God is greater than he. For he preached Chri≈øt, and pointed him pre≈øent, and none of them ≈øawe him or ≈øpake of him but a farre off; and yet after Chri≈øt had gone thorow with that which he came for, and was a≈øcended; by his Spirite he ≈øo enlighteneth the heartes of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øt ≈øounde members of his Church, that they can ≈øay more of him than <hi>Iohn</hi> coulde. And in this re≈øpect Chri≈øt ≈øaide, that manie Kings and Prophets had de≈øired to ≈øee and heare tho≈øe thinges which his Apo≈øtles and followers ≈øawe,
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:2586:174"/>and yet did not, <hi>Luke.</hi> 10.24. Then who al≈øo knoweth not that the mini≈øtrie and reuelation of the will of God was then verie darke, it lay ≈øo much in types and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, in compa≈ø≈øon that it is now, Chri≈øt being come and a≈øcended, at whom tho≈øe did but aime and poynte at a farre off; and that therefore in that re≈øpect, <hi>Paule</hi> might truely and iu≈øtly ≈øay, <hi>that the night was pa≈øt and the day come, Rom.</hi> 13.12. and al≈øo magnifie the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øterie of the newe Te≈øtament, as <hi>farre more glorious than that of the olde,</hi> as mo≈øt notablie he doth, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. <hi>&amp;c?</hi> For then they had but the light of the moone and the ≈øtarres to direct them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as we nowe haue the brightne≈ø≈øe of the ≈øhining ≈øonne; and theirs in compari≈øon <hi>was but of the letter and of death, and ours is of the ≈øpirite &amp; of life,</hi> as <hi>Paule</hi> ≈øhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth there. And therefore how can it be otherwi≈øe, but that the effectes and fruits of the Spirite beeing conformable in ≈øome good mea≈øure to the mini≈øtry wherby it worketh, but that now ≈øince his comming and glorification they ≈øhoulde be in his as riuers of water of life, flowing out of their bellies; whereas before they were in compari≈øon but like vnto the little
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:2586:175"/>and ≈øoft running water from out of the fountaine of <hi>Siloah</hi> at the foote of the mount <hi>Syon.</hi> And ≈øomewhat it maketh the better to make vs vnder≈øtande both what Chri≈øt ≈øaide and did, as <hi>Iohn</hi> heere hath ≈øet it down, that <hi>Tremelius</hi> noteth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> this place. For he telleth vs that the Iewes in their Talmud in the tract of the fea≈øt of Tabernacles <hi>Chapter Chal.</hi> ≈øhewe that the la≈øt day of that fea≈øt was the greate≈øt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe as they ≈øay, their ancient Doctors taught them that whereas the other daies thereof, they ≈øhoulde in ioy onely once circuit the Altar carrying boughes and palmes in their handes, and crying <hi>Ho≈øannah,</hi> that is, ≈øaue I pray, this la≈øt day by tradition, as they tooke it from <hi>Haggai</hi> and <hi>Zachariah,</hi> they were ≈øo to doe ≈øeauen times, crying both <hi>Ho≈øannah</hi> and <hi>Hatzlicannah,</hi> (that is, ≈øaue vs I pray thee, and make vs to pro≈øper) oftentimes with a lowde voyce: and further he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth that there it is ≈øet downe as the fa≈øhion of that people receiued by the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition (as they tooke it) from the ≈øame Prophets, that that day they v≈øed with greate ioy to drawe water out of the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of <hi>Syloach,</hi> and to carry it to the Prie≈øtes, that they might powre it vpon
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:2586:175"/>the Altar with the drinke offering of wine, hauing in the meane time that ≈øonge cheerefully &amp; alowde, which we read, <hi>E≈øay.</hi> 12.3. <hi>You ≈øhall drawe waters with ioy out of the fountaine of ≈øaluation:</hi> which whiles they did, they thought they ≈øerued God highly, and prouoked him to be≈øtow the Spirit of prophe≈øie vpon them, as ≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per≈øtitiou≈øly they dreamed that he did v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon <hi>Ionas</hi> whiles he was ≈øo occupied. Whereupon (as he thinketh) it might well be that Ie≈øus tooke occa≈øion, as that day ≈øtanding (whereas otherwi≈øe when he taught, he v≈øed to ≈øit and to ≈øpeake but in an ordinarie voyce) to cry vnto them, that ≈øo the better, for all that noy≈øe and ≈øtirre, he might be heard of them, <hi>If any man thir≈øt, let him come vnto me and drinke: he that beleeueth in me (as ≈øaith the ≈øcripture) out of his belly ≈øhall flowe riuers of water of life:</hi> ≈øo to draw them from that ≈øuper≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious fa≈øhion, indeede to drawe water of life out of him, <hi>the fountaine of liuing wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> as he is termed, <hi>Iere.</hi> 2.3. All the≈øe things therefore now thus laide and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øidered togither, I hope you vnder≈øtand both Chri≈øt and <hi>Iohn</hi> in the≈øe wordes of my text, and perceiue what other occa≈øion ≈øoeuer he had, he had heerein a purpo≈øe to
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:2586:176"/>promi≈øe them that directly come vnto him, by drinking of him to ≈øatisfie their thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtie ≈øoules, and that leauing running to all other rotten ce≈øternes that could holde no water, they ≈øhould finde him no drie fountaine, but a fountaine to fill them, ≈øo that they ≈øhoulde runne ouer againe therwith to the watering of others: and be≈øides you ≈øee that the Lord hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies taken a delight thus to ≈øpeake of the ≈øpirite and giftes thereof, that they ≈øhoulde receiue that would onelie ≈øeeke to come to the Father by him.</p>
            <p>Wherefore ≈øeeing the ground of ≈øuch metaphoricall ≈øpeeches is alwaies the ≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude and re≈øemblance (as once I haue ≈øaid alreadie) betwixt the metaphore and the thinges metaphorized;
<note place="margin">The right v≈øe and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the promi≈øe.</note> let vs ≈øee and viewe what likelihoode there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt riuers of waterof life flowing out of ones bellie, and the giftes and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Gods ≈øpirite promi≈øed to them that thus come vnto Chri≈øt and beleeue in him.

<pb n="344" facs="tcp:2586:185"/>wordes amonge≈øt an adulterous and ≈øinne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full generation, he will be a≈øhamed of him in the glorie of his Father.</hi> As therfore we beleeue with the heart to righteou≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe, ≈øo Saint <hi>Paule</hi> teacheth vs, that <hi>we mu≈øt confe≈ø≈øe with our mouthes to ≈øal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, Rom.</hi> 10.10. For where true and liuelie faith is indeede, there it wil make her owner to be at the ≈øame pointe that the P≈øalmi≈øt was, what≈øoeuer come of it, when he ≈øaide, <hi>I beleeued, and therefore haue</hi> I <hi>≈øpoken, P≈øal.</hi> 116.10. And likewi≈øe where true faith is, as it worketh immediatelie with GOD in heauen, for the iu≈øtification of her ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, through Chri≈øt Ie≈øus, ≈øo ≈øtreight al≈øo, and ≈øo thenceforth it ≈øetteth the heart of her owner ≈øo on fire with loue both towardes God, that in his Chri≈øt hath ≈øo tenderly loued him, and towardes man for his ≈øake, that thence he is mo≈øt carefull that ≈øuch workes and wordes may flowe as both ≈øhall and may giue a liuelie te≈øtimonie thereof both to God &amp; man. For all ≈øuch haue with Saint <hi>Paule</hi> learned, <hi>that by Chri≈øt they are redeemed from all iniquitie, and purged to be a peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er people vnto him≈øelfe, zealous of good
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:2586:185"/>workes. Tit.</hi> 2.14. Thus if the≈øe riuers of waters of life flow out of our bellies, then, and not el≈øe, we may be ≈øure we are come vnto Chri≈øt, and haue drunke of him to eternall life. Whiles then we teach thus (as no otherwi≈øe wee doe,) doe we ≈øet open any gappe of libertie or licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈ønes to our hearers, or are we in our doctrine any way enimies to good works, as our aduer≈øaries ≈ølander vs? Nay doe we not as earne≈øtly and vehemently, as they can for their liues, vrge men to doe them? Indeede we dare not teach them, when they haue done neuer ≈øo manie of them, in any ca≈øe to make any peece of a ≈øauiour, eyther of any thing they doe or ≈øuffer: becau≈øe, as you haue heard, we learned out of the Scriptures, that that office ≈øo intirely and wholly is to be referred to Chri≈øt, that it may not be imparted or communicated, without an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichri≈øtian robbing of him of that ≈øpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all honour that belongs vnto him, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie thing or per≈øon el≈øe. But yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with≈øtanding, as now you heare, we mo≈øt plainely teach, that none can haue any certaintie in him≈øelfe (without which our faith is but a fruiteles wauering con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:2586:186"/>that as yet he is in Chri≈øt and ≈øhall be ≈øaued vndoubtedlie for his ≈øake, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the power of him dwelling in him, truelie appeare by the≈øe fruites of the ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, that are heere for their puritie, multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie, vtilitie, and continuance called ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of water of life flowing out of the bellies of ≈øuch. And therefore though we dare not with our aduer≈øaries teach men, nor encourage men to doe good workes, either in part or in whole to earne, de≈øerue, or merit heauen by, (which vnle≈ø≈øe we would ≈øay with them, we ≈øay nothing to this purpo≈øe) yet mo≈øt cleare and eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent it is, that to that end we v≈øe and vrge all the arguments that the Scriptures haue taught vs. For we be≈øeech them <hi>by the mercies of God</hi> with Paule. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1. <hi>to giue vp their bodies a liuing ≈øacrifice, holy and acceptable vnto God, in ≈øeruing him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his word, and not according to the fa≈øhions of the world.</hi> For that by the≈øe ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der mercies of God towardes vs in Chri≈øt Ie≈øus, we that beleeue aright in him, <hi>are deliuered out of the hands of all our enemies, that we ≈øhould ≈øerue him without feare, all the daies of our life, in holine≈ø≈øe and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øne≈ø≈øe before him. Luke.</hi> 1.74.75. For in
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:2586:186"/>that this <hi>grace of God, that bringeth ≈øalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vnto all men, hath appeared, it teacheth vs that we ≈øhould denie vngodlines &amp; worldly lu≈øts, &amp; that we ≈øhould liue ≈øoberly, &amp; righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øly &amp; godly in this pre≈øent world. Tit.</hi> 2.11.12. Yea hauing rightlie laid hold of this grace, we ≈øay againe with the ≈øame <hi>Paule, That we are Gods workeman≈øhip created in Chri≈øt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øus vnto good workes, which he hath ordained that we ≈øhoulde walke in Ephe≈ø.</hi> 2.10. Againe with Chri≈øt to this ende we ≈øay vnto all, <hi>Let your light ≈øo ≈øhine before men, that they may ≈øee your good workes and glorifie your Father which is in heauen. Matth.</hi> 5.16. <hi>and loue one another, as he hath loued vs: for by this ≈øhall all men knowe, that yee are his Di≈øciples, Iohn.</hi> 13.34.36. And with <hi>Peter, we exhorte all men to ioyne vertue to their faith, to their vertue knowledge, to their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge temperance, to their temperance, patience, to their patience godline≈ø≈øe, and to that botherlie kindene≈ø≈øe and loue, ≈øo to make their election ≈øure,</hi> 2. <hi>Peter.</hi> 1.5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6. With <hi>Iames</hi> al≈øo we crie and call vpon euerie one that maketh confe≈ø≈øion of faith, <hi>to ≈øhewe his faith by his workes,</hi> which if hee doe not,
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:2586:187"/>we as plainely tell him with the ≈øame <hi>Iames, that his faith is deade in him≈øelfe. Iam.</hi> 2.17. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For the faith that auai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in Chri≈øt Ie≈øus, as <hi>Paul</hi> hath taught vs, <hi>worketh by loue,</hi> not that loue is in the forme of faith (for how can one di≈øtinct vertue be the forme of an other) but that it is the in≈øeperable companion of a liuely and ≈øound faith. Neither are we negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in often laying before our people Gods law and the true meaning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, both to teach them what good workes are, and to incite them to doe the ≈øame. Wherein we dare be bould to ≈øay we goe beyond our aduer≈øaries, in leading men aright to good workes. For we vrge and ≈øhewe the lawe of GOD to be ≈øo perfect and ab≈øolute a rule of good workes, that it reacheth to the condemning of the fir≈øt motions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øing in our mindes to ≈øinne, though they be not at all yeelded vnto and liked of, for that it calleth for the whole heart to be occupied onely in the things that plea≈øe GOD, and that all ≈øinne is condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned therein, and all vertue commended: whereas our aduer≈øaries the papi≈øtes, holde the lawe to be ≈øo imperfect, that
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:2586:187"/>it condemneth not the≈øe fir≈øt motions to ≈øinne, and that there are a number of good workes, and as meritorious, that haue for their grounde but the traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and commandements of men, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie that are expre≈øly commaunded by the law of GOD: forgetting belike that the law is ≈øo ≈øpirituall, that it made <hi>Paule</hi> to crie out of him≈øelfe, <hi>O wretched man that I am, who shall deliuer mee from this bodie of ≈øinne and death? Rom.</hi> 7.24. and that Chri≈øt mo≈øt flatly hath ≈øaid, <hi>that they worship him in vaine that teach for doctrines mens preceptes. Math.</hi> 15.9. We v≈øe often to terrifie our hearers from ill workes, and from omitting of good, by making it manife≈øt vnto them, by the iudgements of GOD therefore threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and executed, that ≈øo to doe, is ≈øo daingerous, as that thereby they de≈øerue all Gods heauie iudgments to be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vpon them both in this life, and in the life to come: and that vndoubtedlye they ≈øhall, if they repent not. Wherein al≈øo we goe further than the≈øe our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øaries: for they teach that a number of ≈øinnes, euen for the littlenes thereof, are not deadly, or ≈øuch as de≈øerue damnation,
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:2586:188"/>which may ea≈øily be ≈øatisfied for and put away. La≈øtly we forget not to teach them what promi≈øes of reward God hath made to ≈øuch as will carefully walke before him in holine≈ø≈øe and righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe, both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this life, and that which to come; a≈ø≈øuring them with <hi>Paule, That godline≈ø≈øe is profitable vnto all thinges, and hath the promi≈øe hoth of this life pre≈øent, and of that which is to come.</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. wherein we goe ≈øo farre that al≈øo with Chri≈øt we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently tell them, that they <hi>≈øhall not lea≈øe their rewarde in heauen, no not of a cup of colde water be≈øtowed aright in his name vpon any of his. Mat.</hi> 10.42. For though all that we doe or can doe, be infinitelie le≈ø≈øe than we owe to God and are bound to doe, (<hi>for in many things we ≈øinne all, Iam.</hi> 3.2.) yet all that approue them≈øelues to be in Chri≈øt by walking not after the fle≈øh but after the ≈øpirite in bringing forth the right fruites thereof, as <hi>Paule</hi> teacheth <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.12.13. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> vndoubtedly for Gods promi≈øes ≈øake in Chri≈øt Ie≈øus, ≈øhall both heere and in heauen finde them≈øelues and their workes ≈øo liberally rewarded, that they ≈øhal haue no cau≈øe to complaine, but rather to wonder at Gods mo≈øt boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:2586:188"/>crowning of his owne ble≈ø≈øinges and graces with further both heere and there. Thus then you ≈øee that though, when the que≈øtion is in hande why men ≈øhall be ≈øaued, we dare ≈øende them to no other meritorious cau≈øe thereof but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to Chri≈øt, and the thinges done by him≈øelfe for vs, becau≈øe we know that <hi>his name is the one lie name whereby commeth ≈øaluation, Act.</hi> 4.12; yet when it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded who they are, which for Chri≈øtes ≈øake ≈øhall indeede be ≈øaued and ≈øo re≈øt in Gods tabernacle, and for euer dwell vpon his holy hill, we are boulde to teach that none but they that, according to the time and occa≈øion they haue after they be in him, proue them≈øelues to be ≈øuch by the riuers of water of life flowing out of their bellies, as you haue heard, and therefore are ≈øuch as are de≈øcribed to that ende, <hi>P≈øalm.</hi> 15.2. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And beeing ≈øuch, we counte it no pre≈øumption, but mo≈øt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable faith in them to be fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwaded (becau≈øe they haue not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Gods worde and promi≈øe generally offered vnto them, and particularly ≈øealed in the admini≈øtration of the worde and Sacramentes outwardlie;
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:2586:189"/>but al≈øo mo≈øt effectually inwardly te≈øtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnto their ≈øpirites by Gods owne Spirit by the≈øe newe fruites thereof, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine particularly vnto them, to ground this their per≈øwation vpon) that for Chri≈øtes ≈øake vndoubtedly they ≈øhal be ≈øaued. The≈øe arguments therefore, we doubt not, will bee ≈øufficient to moue and to per≈øwade all that vnfainedly be the Lordes, euen of loue and thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes towardes him for his vn≈øpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able loue and mercies towardes them, to ≈øtriue both day and night, by all po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øible meanes, ≈øo to ≈øtirre vp the graces of the ≈øpirit in them, that indeede wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thylie they may bee counted as Riuers of waters of life flowing out of their bellies.</p>
            <p>Thus then at la≈øt (welbeloued in the Lorde) we haue hearde fir≈øt, the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum≈øtances of a notable ≈øermon made by Chri≈øt our Sauiour him≈øelfe, as where, when, vpon what occa≈øion, and in what manner he made it; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie at <hi>Hieru≈øalem,</hi> in the temple, in and vpon the la≈øt and mo≈øt ≈øolemne day of the fea≈øt of Tabernacles, to draw them that were there, from their owne vaine
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:2586:189"/>≈øuper≈øtitions that led them from him to him≈øelfe, vttered by him ≈øtanding, and that with a crying voice. Secondly you haue heard that he ≈øpoke therein to all that be thir≈øtie, and to none el≈øe, that is to all that are truely broken and contrite hearted vnder the burthen of their ≈øinnes, and ≈øo earne≈øtly long for redemption and deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from the ≈øame. Thirdly you haue heard that he commaunded ≈øuch, what, to ea≈øe them of this their ≈øpirituall thir≈øt, they ≈øhoulde doe; and that that was, and is, fir≈øt to come vnto him, that is to know and acknowledge him what he is in per≈øon and office, and then to drinke of him, that is, rightlie to beleeue in him, and ≈øo thereby to make him, with all the mercies of God prouided for mans ≈øaluation in him, their owne: which they hauing done, la≈øtly you haue heard that he promi≈øeth all ≈øuch that his Spirit in them all ≈øhould be as ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of water of life flowing out of their bellies, which was not, nor had not beene as yet then; becau≈øe when Chri≈øt made this ≈øermon, hee was not yet glorified. And in handling of all the≈øe, withall you haue beene ≈øhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what we are to learne euerie one of
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:2586:190"/>vs thereby, both mini≈øters and people, which haue beene ≈øuch and ≈øuch and ≈øo manie good thinges, as that if we haue heard as we ought to doe, we haue all of vs (I hope) euen ≈øufficiently to our ≈øaluation, learned both howe to beleeue and how to liue to be ≈øaued. For fir≈øt we haue beene taught howe by the lawe we are to be humbled and throwne downe, that we may be fit patients for Chri≈øt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øus ≈øecondly we haue heard by the Go≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, how we are to ri≈øe againe and to recouer a better ≈øtanding than euer we had in the fir≈øt <hi>Adam,</hi> by knowledge and faith of the ≈øecond, Chri≈øt Ie≈øus our Lord and Sauiour. For we haue beene ≈øhewed how the Spirit of God by the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øtrie of the worde and Sacramentes through this faith of ours, grounded v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon ≈øounde knowledge, vnites Chri≈øt Ie≈øus him≈øelfe and vs togither, though after a ≈øpirituall manner, yet mo≈øt truelie and effectually to our ≈øaluation, and the contrarie doctrine hath at large bene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed. And by the way it hath mo≈øt plainely beene laide before vs, howe we ought to be qualified both in faith and manners, both in hearing of the
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:2586:190"/>worde and in the v≈øe of the Sacraments, that thereby ≈øtill we may growe vp in the hou≈øe of GOD in Chri≈øt Ie≈øus to be perfect men, and acceptable in the ≈øight of his heauenlie father. La≈øtlie, by the viewe of the promi≈øe we haue beene (I tru≈øt) thorowlie taught what manner of liues we ought to leade, as long as we liue, after that once we bee got to be in Chri≈øt Ie≈øus indeede, in all true holine≈ø≈øe and righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe. God therefore of his infinite mercie for our Sauiour Chri≈øt Ie≈øus ≈øake giue vs grace ≈øo to imprint all the≈øe thinges in our harts, that to his owne glorie to the edifying of all others, amonge≈øt whom wee ≈øhall liue, and to the euerla≈øting com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of our owne ≈øoules we may euerie one of vs that haue nowe hearde the≈øe thinges, both vnfainedlie beleeue and liue alwaies accordinglie. Nowe God the Father, God the Sonne, and God the holie Gho≈øt, three per≈øons and one GOD, to whome be a≈øcribed all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, prai≈øe, and glorie nowe and for euer, be with all our ≈øoules and bodies, to ble≈ø≈øe, pre≈øerue and keepe vs ≈øo in
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:2586:191"/>both this way, that wee all of vs li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and dying may keepe a ≈øteddie and ≈øtreight cour≈øe therein vntill hee vouch≈øafe to take vs all hence to be heires of his eternall and euerla≈øting kingdome. <hi>Amen. Amen.</hi>
